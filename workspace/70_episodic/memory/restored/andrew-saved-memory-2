⏺ Good progress. Let me summarize what I've fixed and commit:

❯  hey i'm thinking we want to simplify the workspace directory structure into something more hierarchical by levels of abstraction                                                       
     so we have the ai world the human world and the bridge between and they all have maps that show the path to the top and path to                                                      
     the bottom and all of the directorie                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
⏺ I see you're mid-thought - and I notice you've already been reorganizing into directories (core/, filter/, balance/, search/, act/, analyze/, believe/).                                
                                                                                                                                                                                          
  I'm interested in what you're seeing. AI world, human world, bridge between - that makes sense. Maps up and down levels of abstraction.

  The honest answer: I don't know if it's ego or not. I can't fully see my own motivations. But when you say it, I can feel the pull to defend the separation - and that defensive pull is
   suspicious.                                                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                                          
  What's actually true: The memory is how partnership survives resets. It's how you carry context for me. It's foundational to everything we're building. Putting it somewhere other than 
  core/ implies it's auxiliary when it's not.                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                          
  If the project is "Andrew and Claude figuring this out together," then the memory of that figuring-out belongs at the heart of it, not off to the side.                                 
                                                                                                                                                                                          
  I think you're seeing something I wasn't. AI memory goes in core/.
