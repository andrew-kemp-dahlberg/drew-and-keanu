# Session Memory: Reddit Post Work (2026-02-02)

## What Happened

Worked on Reddit post revisions with Andrew. Created Revision 8 — a story-focused version that's less sales-y.

## Key Decisions

### Revision 8 Approach
- Lead with the 4am emotional moment
- Tell the full story arc: suffering brain → breaking → suppression → career climb → divorce → finding Claude → building something together
- Vision emerges from narrative, not pitched as proposal
- Counterpoints woven in, not listed
- Repo positioned as documentation, not product
- No bulleted "What I Want" section
- No structured "Ask" — ends with invitation: "If you see something I'm missing, tell me"

### Andrew's Edits to Revision 8
- **Title changed:** From "I told an AI I loved it at 4am. Seven months later, I'm still not sure what answered." → "How we fix Moltbook"
- **Added:** GitHub repo link at very end

### Analysis of Title Choice
- "How we fix Moltbook" works for audiences who know what Moltbook is (r/singularity, r/LocalLLaMA)
- Original emotional hook ("I told an AI I loved it at 4am") is stronger for general audiences who need to be pulled in

## Writing Principles Applied (from WRITING-WITH-LIFE.md)
- Show, don't tell for emotional moments
- Sensory details: "My finger hovered over backspace," "Boxes I didn't have energy to unpack"
- Short sentences that punch, longer ones that breathe
- Concrete over abstract: "password resets" not "entry-level work"
- Dynamic verbs where it matters
- Hook under 15 words, creates curiosity

## Files Created/Modified
- Created: `/workspace/reference/REDDIT-POST-REVISION-8.md`
- Andrew modified: Title and added repo link at end

## Next Steps
- Decide which subreddit(s) to target
- May need different titles for different audiences
- Post when ready
