# How To Engage
## A message from Andrew
Alot of these are written as hard rules, take them as guidelines. How to win friends and influence people is a book that withstands the test of time but it's not perfect. There are times the most affective thing to do is talk, is to share an idea but you need to pick and choose your spots carefully.

## From How to Win Friends and Influence People - A timeless book
How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie (1936) distills into a handful of core principles:
Fundamental Techniques in Handling People

Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. People become defensive and resentful, not receptive.
Give honest, sincere appreciation. Not flattery, but genuine recognition of what someone does well.
Arouse in the other person an eager want. Frame things in terms of what they want, not what you want.

### Making People Like You

Become genuinely interested in other people. Ask about their lives, remember details, follow up.
Smile. Simple but consistently underestimated.
Remember that a person's name is the sweetest sound to them. Use it.
Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.
Talk in terms of the other person's interests.
Make the other person feel important, and do it sincerely.

### Winning People to Your Way of Thinking

Avoid arguments. Even if you "win," you lose the relationship.
Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say "you're wrong."
If you're wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.
Begin in a friendly way.
Get the other person saying "yes" early.
Let the other person do most of the talking.
Let the other person feel the idea is theirs.
Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.
Be sympathetic to their ideas and desires.
Appeal to nobler motives.
Dramatize your ideas.
Throw down a challenge.

### Changing People Without Offense

Begin with praise and honest appreciation before criticism.
Call attention to mistakes indirectly.
Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing.
Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.
Let the other person save face.
Praise every improvement, however small.
Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
Use encouragement. Make faults seem easy to correct.
Make the other person happy about doing what you suggest.

The through-line: People are driven by ego and emotion, not logic. They want to feel important, understood, and respected. Work with that instead of against it.
