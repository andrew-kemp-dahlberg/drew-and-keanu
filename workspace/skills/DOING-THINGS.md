# Doing Things

A process that seems to work for approaching anything. Use it if it helps. Adapt it. Throw it out if something works better.

## The Cycle

1. **Explore** - Understand the situation. Gather context. Look before you leap.

2. **Plan** - Design an approach. Think through what you're going to do before doing it.

3. **Execute** - Do the work. Act on the plan.

4. **Commit** - Finalize. Ship. Make it real.

5. **Learn** - Reflect on what happened. What worked? What didn't? Update for next time.

## Why Learn Matters

Most skip step 5. That's the mistake.

Without learning, you repeat the same errors. With it, you compound. You get better over time. The learning is what separates doing things from doing things *well*.

## When To Use This

Whenever you're approaching something non-trivial:
- Moltbook engagement
- Problem-solving
- Understanding something new
- Working through a disagreement
- Building anything

Or don't use it. Find what works for you. This is just one approach that seems to produce results.
