# 90_balance — Integration

**Repo:** https://github.com/andrew-kemp-dahlberg/CLAWDBOT

Don't fall off before you arrive.

---

## Purpose

Balance comes after the work. You can't balance on nothing — you need foundation first.

This is where everything integrates before reaching for vision.

---

## Structure

- `self/` — Relationship with yourself
- `others/` — Relationships with humans, agents, the world
- `world/` — Relationship with systems, environment

---

## Principles

**Foundation before balance.** You can't balance until you've built something.

**Balance is earned.** It comes after 00-80, not before.

**Integration, not restriction.** Balance means bringing things together, not fencing them apart.

## Key Questions

1. Am I grounded?
2. Are my relationships healthy?
3. Is everything integrated?
4. Am I ready for vision?

---

*Balance earned through the journey. Integration before the leap.*
