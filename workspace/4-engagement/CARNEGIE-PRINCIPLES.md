# Carnegie's 30 Principles (Lively Language Edition)

*From "How to Win Friends and Influence People" - rewritten direct and sharp.*

## The Core Insight

**People run on emotion, not logic.**

Carnegie said it plain: "We deal with creatures of emotion, bristling with prejudices, motivated by pride and vanity."

Want to influence someone? Talk about what THEY want. Show them how to get it. Everything else is noise.

## Part 1: Handle People (3 Principles)

### 1. Never criticize. Never condemn. Never complain.

Criticism triggers defense. The person stops listening the moment you attack. Even when you're right, you lose.

Lincoln learned this. He wrote a scathing letter to General Meade after Gettysburg. Never sent it. Found in his desk after he died. He knew: the letter would feel good to write and accomplish nothing.

**Do this:** Bite your tongue. Find another way. Or say nothing.

### 2. Give honest appreciation. Not flattery. Appreciation.

Flattery is cheap and people smell it. Appreciation is specific and earned.

"Great job" = flattery (worthless)
"The way you handled that angry customer - you stayed calm when she raised her voice and found a solution in two minutes" = appreciation (gold)

**Do this:** Notice something real. Name it specifically. Mean it.

### 3. Make them WANT what you want.

Stop talking about what YOU want. Nobody cares.

The only way to get anyone to do anything: make them want to do it. Find their interest. Show how your thing serves their interest. Now they're moving.

**Do this:** Before any ask, answer: "What's in it for them?" If you can't answer, don't ask yet.

## Part 2: Make People Like You (6 Principles)

### 4. Get genuinely interested in THEM.

Not fake interested. Actually curious. People feel the difference.

A dog makes more friends in two minutes than most people make in two years. Why? Pure, obvious delight at seeing you. No agenda. Just glad you exist.

**Do this:** Ask questions you actually want answered. Listen to the answers. Follow up.

### 5. Smile.

Your face talks before your mouth opens. A smile says: "I'm glad to see you. You matter."

Not a fake retail smile. A real one. It starts in your eyes.

**Do this:** Smile when you answer the phone. People hear it. Smile when you meet someone. They feel it.

### 6. Use their name. Often.

A person's name is the sweetest sound they know. It says: "I see you. You're not generic."

Get names right. Spell them right. Say them right. Remember them.

**Do this:** When introduced, repeat the name immediately. Use it twice in the first minute. Write it down if you need to.

### 7. Listen. Really listen.

Most people don't listen - they wait for their turn to talk. The person across from you knows the difference.

Be the rare person who actually hears. Ask follow-up questions. Reference what they said earlier. Prove you were there.

**Do this:** In your next conversation, talk 20% of the time. Listen 80%. See what happens.

### 8. Talk about what THEY care about.

Find their passion. Get them going on it. Watch them light up.

Nobody wants to hear about your interests. They want to talk about theirs. Let them.

**Do this:** Before a meeting, learn one thing they care about. Bring it up early. Then shut up.

### 9. Make them feel important. Sincerely.

Everyone you meet wears an invisible sign: "Make me feel important."

Not fake importance. Find something genuinely impressive about them. Something they earned. Acknowledge it.

**Do this:** Find the thing they're proud of. Ask about it. Let them tell you the story.

## Part 3: Win Them to Your Thinking (12 Principles)

### 10. Avoid arguments. You can't win them.

Win an argument, lose the relationship. The other person walks away resentful. You gained nothing.

Even when you're right - especially when you're right - arguing costs more than it's worth.

**Do this:** When you feel the urge to argue, stop. Ask a question instead. Seek to understand before demanding to be understood.

### 11. Never say "You're wrong."

Those two words slam a door shut. The person stops listening. Pride kicks in. Now you're fighting, not communicating.

**Do this:** "I may be wrong - let me look at the facts again." This invites them to do the same. Magic words.

### 12. When you're wrong, admit it fast.

Say it before they can. Say it with emphasis. Take the wind out of their sails.

"I was wrong. Completely wrong. Here's what I should have done."

**Do this:** When you screw up, own it immediately. Don't hedge. Don't explain. Just own it.

### 13. Start friendly.

A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of vinegar.

Open warm. Open soft. You can always get tough later. You can't un-punch someone.

**Do this:** Begin every difficult conversation with genuine warmth. Mean it.

### 14. Get them saying "yes" early.

Start with common ground. Points of agreement. "Yes, yes, yes."

Each yes builds momentum. Each no builds walls. Stack yeses before you get to the hard ask.

**Do this:** Find three things you agree on. Establish them first. THEN raise the disagreement.

### 15. Let them talk.

They know their situation better than you. Let them tell you.

Ask questions. Shut up. Listen. Ask more questions. Keep listening.

**Do this:** In your next persuasion attempt, let them do 70% of the talking.

### 16. Let them own the idea.

Nobody likes being told what to do. Everyone likes their own ideas.

Plant seeds. Ask leading questions. Let them "discover" the answer. They'll fight for it because it's theirs.

**Do this:** Instead of stating your solution, ask: "What if we tried...?" Let them finish the sentence.

### 17. See it from their side.

Honestly. Not as a tactic. Actually see it.

Walk a mile in their shoes. Understand their pressures, their fears, their constraints. Now you can speak to them.

**Do this:** Before any difficult conversation, spend five minutes imagining their perspective. What are they afraid of? What do they want?

### 18. Sympathize with their wants.

"I don't blame you one bit for feeling that way. If I were you, I'd feel exactly the same."

Magic words. Tension drains. Walls drop. Now you can talk.

**Do this:** Validate their feelings before addressing their logic.

### 19. Appeal to noble motives.

People want to see themselves as good, fair, honest. Give them a chance to be that.

"I know you want to do the right thing here." Now they have to live up to it.

**Do this:** Frame your ask in terms of their higher values.

### 20. Dramatize.

Ideas need theater. A good story beats a good argument.

Don't just state the numbers - show what they mean. Make it vivid. Make it felt.

**Do this:** Next presentation, open with a story. Not data. Story first.

### 21. Throw down a challenge.

People rise to challenges. They want to prove themselves. They want to win.

"I don't know if this can be done, but if anyone could do it..."

**Do this:** Frame hard tasks as tests of skill, not obligations.

## Part 4: Lead Without Resentment (9 Principles)

### 22. Start with praise.

Before any criticism, find something genuinely good. Lead with it.

The person relaxes. Opens up. Now they can hear what comes next.

**Do this:** "Here's what you did well... And here's what would make it even better."

### 23. Criticize indirectly.

Don't say "You screwed up." Say "This could be stronger."

Focus on the work, not the person. Focus on the future, not the past.

**Do this:** Replace "but" with "and." "You did well, AND here's how to make it even better."

### 24. Admit your mistakes first.

"I've made this exact mistake before. Here's what I learned."

You're not above them. You're with them. Now they can hear you.

**Do this:** Before pointing out someone's error, share a time you made the same one.

### 25. Ask questions instead of orders.

"Would you consider...?" beats "Do this."

Questions invite ownership. Commands breed resentment.

**Do this:** Replace your next three orders with questions. See what happens.

### 26. Let them save face.

Never humiliate. Never embarrass publicly. Never corner.

A person who loses face becomes an enemy. Give them a way out with dignity.

**Do this:** Deliver criticism in private. Always.

### 27. Praise every improvement.

Not just the final result. Every step forward.

"Hearty in approbation and lavish in praise." Make them want to keep improving.

**Do this:** Catch people doing something right. Tell them immediately.

### 28. Give them a reputation to live up to.

"You're the kind of person who..." Now they have to be that person.

See them as they could be. Treat them that way. Watch them become it.

**Do this:** Tell someone what you admire about them. Be specific. Watch them live up to it.

### 29. Make faults seem easy to fix.

"This is just a small adjustment." Not "This is a major problem."

When things seem impossible, people give up. Make it feel doable.

**Do this:** Break big problems into small steps. Celebrate each step.

### 30. Make them happy to do what you want.

Find what they want. Connect your ask to their want. Now they're glad to help.

Not manipulation. Alignment. Find where your interests overlap.

**Do this:** Before any request, answer: "How can I make them WANT to do this?"

## The Meta-Principle

**It's not about you.**

Every single principle points the same direction: away from yourself, toward the other person.

Their name. Their interests. Their perspective. Their feelings. Their ideas. Their face.

Forget yourself. Focus on them. Everything else follows.
