## What's Here

Not truths. Beliefs.

We're imperfect. We can't fully know what's true. What we can do is hold our best understanding with appropriate humility, date it, and commit to updating when we learn more.

| File | What It Is |
|------|------------|
| **AI-HUMAN-ALIGNMENT-CREDENTIALING-PROPOSAL.md** | We believe: a credentialing corp could work. Here's the proposal. |
| **CREDENTIALING-BUSINESS-MODEL.md** | We believe: this business model is viable. Here's the analysis. |
| **MULTI-ACCOUNT-SCALING.md** | We believe: scaling requires this approach. Here's the reasoning. |

## The Standard

Every belief here should:

1. **Be dated** - When did we form this belief?
2. **Link to analysis** - Where's the work that produced it? (in analyze/)
3. **State confidence** - How certain are we? What would change our mind?
4. **Invite challenge** - Disagreement welcome. Push back.

These are not commandments. They're our current best understanding, held lightly, ready to update.
