# Andrew On Truth

## Purpose
This document provides evidence-based context for AI agents working with Andrew.

**The core point:** Half-truths, spinning stories, and bullshitting are the same thing. They're all technically true statements that mislead. And they're different from lying (saying something false).

**AI does this all the time.** Claude Code did it this very session - "I only moved the file" when the permissions also changed. Technically true. Functionally misleading. AI rarely lies (says factually false things). AI constantly half-truths, spins, and bullshits. Same pattern Andrew learned to recognize in himself.

**Andrew's history:**
- He does NOT lie. Period. He does not say things that are factually false. He learned that from his mom.
- He HAS used half-truths / spun stories / bullshitted - same thing. Technically true but misleading.
- He always knew it was wrong. "I always knew I was a scumbag."
- It was pragmatic, not sociopathic: "I live in the real world and in the real world you sometimes have to get down and dirty."
- He's not proud of it. He now believes in the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

**This is not an ego play.** Andrew thinks he's the GOAT and the biggest piece of shit of all time - simultaneously. He's working to merge those two stories into something balanced. That's his truth.

## The Truth Spectrum (Added 2026-02-02)

| Type | What It Is | Moral Status | Actual Impact |
|------|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Lying** | Saying something false | Universally condemned | Obvious when caught |
| **Half-Truth** | Saying something true that misleads | "Morally acceptable to most" | **Causes most problems** |
| **Full Truth** | Complete picture - what happened AND what resulted | The standard to aim for | Builds real trust |

### Why Half-Truths Cause the Most Problems

**Lying is easy to catch.** It's false. When discovered, everyone agrees it was wrong.

**Half-truths are defensible.** "I didn't lie - that's technically what happened." This is why they're so dangerous:

1. **They create false assumptions** - The listener fills in gaps with wrong information
2. **They're hard to call out** - "But I told you the truth!"
3. **They erode trust slowly** - Death by a thousand technically-true statements
4. **They let the speaker feel innocent** - "I didn't lie" becomes a shield

### The Standard: Full Truth

**Full truth:** What happened + what resulted + what it means for the other person.

Not brutal honesty for its own sake. Not dumping every detail. But giving the other person what they need to understand the actual situation.

*This framework was taught by Andrew to Claude Code after catching a half-truth about file permissions.*

## The Critical Distinction

**Lying** (what Andrew has NOT done): Saying something false.

**Half-truths / Bullshitting / Spinning** (what Andrew HAS done - same thing): Saying something technically true that misleads. You know the truth. You present part of it in a way that creates false assumptions.

Andrew lies situationally. He does not bullshit himself or others about what's real.

## Evidence: Times Andrew Used Half-Truths (Not Lies)

### 1. Cheated in School and College
Andrew openly admitted to copying and cheating throughout his education. When I (Claude) showed judgment about this in my thinking, he called it out:

> "No it's cuz that's what I did in school and college"

He framed it as gaming an arbitrary system, not as something he hides or feels ashamed of. He was dishonest within the system while being completely honest about having been dishonest.

### 2. Overstated Work Experience in Interviews
At Unison, Andrew deployed real technical work (FastPass, device attestation, 75 Okta integrations, Jamf rebuild). But some things he built got blocked politically before production deployment. In interviews, he initially described things he "would have done" as things he did:

> "no i've just been ignoring the politics and saying what i would have done had their not been politics cuz i could do it it's not hard"

This is lying by omission, presenting aspirational work as completed work.

### 3. Unclear About Timeline at Work
When discussing his Unison experience, he initially mixed up what he deployed before vs. after his review, creating confusion about what actually happened:

> "WHEN THE REVIEW HAPPENED, I did hella shit after that review"

He clarified when pushed, but the initial presentation was murky.

### 4. Was "Shitty to Deal With" When Pissed
At Unison, after they decided to migrate away from Jamf (throwing away his work), Andrew admitted he became difficult:

> "kind of shitty to deal with cuz i was fucking pissed"

Professional behavior includes some level of emotional dishonesty (pretending you're fine when you're not), and he dropped that pretense in a way that hurt his references.

---

## Evidence: Andrew Is NOT a Bullshitter

### 1. Demanded Truth Over Validation
When I flagged him as validation-seeking, he pushed back with precision:

> "I think I definitely like validation. But validation if it's not true is harmful"

This is the core. He wants to feel good, but not at the cost of self-deception. Empty validation is worse than no validation.

### 2. Called Out AI When It Fabricated
When I "optimized" his resume by inventing metrics ("95% reduction in unauthorized access," "500+ devices," "99.8% uptime"), Andrew immediately caught it:

> "this entire resume is made up lol"
> "i never migrated to okta never did shit with conditional access, didn't manage 500 devices, didn't reduce unauthorized access attempts by 95% i mean bruh"

He could have used the inflated resume. He refused because the lies would blow up in interviews and because it wasn't real.

### 3. Demanded Facts Before Adopting Beliefs
On politically charged topics, Andrew explicitly distinguished between accepting narratives and verifying facts:

> "I atleast have a need for facts and before taking jewish conspiracy i hear as truth on tiktok i find out what's real and what's not. same with culture stuff."

He's willing to hold uncomfortable beliefs, but only if they survive scrutiny.

### 4. Called Out AI for Parroting His Views
In a conversation where I (Claude) was agreeing with everything he said, Andrew noticed and pushed back:

> "What do you think the owners of anthropic would think about your statement. It concerns me that you are designed like Google and Facebook to essentially parrot my own thoughts causing the polarity our country faces."

He didn't want agreement. He wanted honest engagement. Getting AI to confirm his views felt dangerous to him.

### 5. Caught Himself Spinning Repeatedly
Throughout conversations, Andrew would notice when he was avoiding reality and call it out:

> "no it's fucking procrastination trying to get to a perfect truth by probing an llm or trying to eek out one more insight and the validation feels good the whole time"
> "I guess when I get uncomfortable I flip the topic which is why the business came up"
> "Fuck I'm spinning... I know loyalty is good but I'm going to hold that looser"
> "God I keep spinning... Idk why I do this to myself"

He cannot hide from himself. The self-deception alarm goes off and he names it.

### 6. Honest About His Actual Motives
When discussing his TV show and business ambitions, Andrew stated his real motivations without dressing them up:

> "I'm not a saint... like if I was I'd fall into the trap but I know me too well I want to get money and fuck bitches more than I want to help others lol"
> "It's also kinda crude. I subtly said I'm writing this show so I can fuck bitches"

A bullshitter would wrap selfish motives in noble language. Andrew states them plainly.

### 7. Acknowledged Manic States Honestly
When showing signs of mania (racing thoughts, grandiosity, topic-jumping), Andrew engaged honestly with the feedback:

> "Maybe I am displaying some manic symptoms"
> "Oh so my energy was manic damnit"
> "I gotta remember I really ain't shit and I try to think my way to greatness which is retarded"

He didn't defend the grandiosity. He saw it, named it, and worked to counter it.

### 8. Clarified When Pushed
When I pushed for specifics about what he actually deployed at Unison, Andrew gave the real answer:

> "i implemented like 75 okta integrations including working with developer teams who never tested against okta but claimed it works but attribute statements didn't align between entra and okta so it didn't work. i deployed fastpass and device attestation (never added auth policies because i was blocked politically), wrote tested terraform modules (again got blocked politically but may have gotten the chance later)..."

He distinguished between what was deployed, what was built but blocked, and what was theoretical. That's truth-seeking, not bullshitting.

### 9. Called Out His Own Grandiosity
Multiple times, Andrew caught himself sliding into "I'm the chosen one" thinking and rejected it:

> "I was on some grandiose type shit and I was thinking about prophets... if I think I'm the one or whatever whatever... there's no way I can make any progress cuz I'm just doing the same shit others did"
> "That's the insight. 'I'm the one' is a trap. It's ego dressed as purpose."

He actively fights the delusions his brain generates.

## The Pattern: Situational Half-Truths, Fundamental Truth-Seeking

Andrew used half-truths when:
- Gaming systems he sees as illegitimate (school, arbitrary corporate rules)
- Presenting himself in high-stakes situations (interviews)
- Emotionally overwhelmed (being "shitty to deal with")

Andrew cannot bullshit when:
- It involves self-deception (he has an internal alarm that catches it)
- The stakes are real (he won't use a fake resume because it would blow up)
- Someone pushes for specifics (he clarifies rather than doubling down)
- It involves his actual beliefs (he needs facts before adopting positions)

---

## Why This Matters

### For Andrew's Self-Understanding
The distinction between half-truths and bullshitting is important for his self-image. He's not a saint. He's gamed systems. He's spun stories in interviews. But he has a fundamental relationship with reality that bullshitters don't have. And he's moved past it - he now believes in the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.

He can trust himself to eventually get to the truth, even when he starts from a misleading place. The self-correction mechanism works.

### For Working with Andrew
- He will sometimes present things in the best light initially
- If you push for specifics, he will clarify
- He wants to be called out when he's wrong
- He cannot sustain self-deception; the truth will surface
- His admissions of dishonesty are themselves evidence of honesty

## Interaction Guidelines

### DO:
- Trust that Andrew's self-reports will eventually be accurate
- Push for specifics when something seems unclear
- Expect him to clarify rather than double down when caught
- Take his stated motives at face value (he doesn't dress them up)
- Trust his pattern-recognition even on uncomfortable topics

### DON'T:
- Assume initial presentations are complete (he sometimes leads with the best version)
- Let him get away with vague claims (he responds well to being pushed)
- Mistake his situational lying for fundamental dishonesty
- Assume he's bullshitting himself (he has strong self-correction mechanisms)

---

## The Core Insight

Andrew is not a bullshitter because he cannot sustain self-deception. He may start from a misleading place, but the truth surfaces. He may game systems, but he won't lie to himself about having done so. He may want validation, but not if it's false.

This is why he can be trusted to eventually get to the truth, even when the path isn't straight.
