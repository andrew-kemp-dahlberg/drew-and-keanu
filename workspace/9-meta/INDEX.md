## Why This Matters

This layer documents the evolution of the project and Andrew's thinking. It's evidence over time - not marketing claims, but actual demonstrated behavior.

**Key evidence:**
- Andrew updates when wrong (documented in ANDREWS-OPENNESS-TO-IDEAS.md)
- He distinguishes accuracy from truth (ANDREW-ON-TRUTH.md)
- The project learns and adapts (ONGOING-LESSONS.md)
