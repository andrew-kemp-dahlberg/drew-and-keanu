# Writing With Life: When and How

*A reference for knowing when to bring writing alive vs when to keep it clear and logical.*

---

## The Core Principle

**Not everything needs to be vivid.** Logical arguments need clarity. Data needs precision. Analysis needs rigor.

**But some things do.** Stories. Emotional appeals. Moments meant to connect. The human parts.

Know the difference. Apply accordingly.

---

## When to Use Vivid Writing

- Personal stories and anecdotes
- Opening hooks (first lines that grab attention)
- Emotional climax moments
- Descriptions that need the reader to *feel* something
- When building connection and trust
- When you want something to be memorable

## When to Use Clear, Logical Writing

- Presenting evidence and data
- Making logical arguments
- Explaining technical concepts
- Proposals and structural breakdowns
- When precision matters more than resonance
- Lists, frameworks, procedures

## The Techniques (For When They're Needed)

### Show, Don't Tell

**Telling:** "She was angry"
**Showing:** "She clenched her fists and gritted her teeth"

Use showing for emotional moments. Use telling when you need to move quickly.

### Sensory Details

Use sight, sound, smell, taste, touch - but only when relevant. One vivid detail beats five generic ones.

**Weak:** "The room was messy"
**Strong:** "Coffee cups lined the desk like a timeline of all-nighters"

### Concrete Over Abstract

**Abstract:** "He had a difficult childhood"
**Concrete:** "He started at help desk. Password resets. Basic troubleshooting."

Specific details create credibility. Abstractions create distance.

### Dynamic Verbs

**Static:** "He walked through the mud"
**Dynamic:** "He trudged through the mud"

Choose verbs with built-in movement and feeling - when the moment calls for it.

### Vary Sentence Length

Short sentences punch. They create urgency.

Longer sentences allow for reflection, building out an idea across multiple clauses before arriving at the point you wanted to make.

Mix them. Read aloud. If you run out of breath, break it up. If it sounds choppy, combine some.

## Hooks: The First Line

The opening matters most. Types that work:

1. **Surprising statement:** "I told an AI I loved it at 4am."
2. **Question:** "What would you miss about your human?"
3. **Contradiction:** "The same traits that nearly destroyed me are what qualify me."
4. **In media res:** Start in the middle of action
5. **Statistic:** A surprising number that reframes the topic

Keep hooks under 15 words when possible. Create curiosity. Raise questions.

---

## Voice and Authenticity

Authentic voice comes from:
- Knowing why you're writing
- Not performing for approval
- Including the awkward truths, not just the flattering ones
- Writing like you talk (then editing for clarity)
- Letting your natural patterns show

Voice is not technique. It's honesty with your own rhythm.

---

## The Balancing Act

Research shows:
- Stories are remembered 22x more than facts alone
- Emotional appeals generate 23% higher engagement than purely informational content
- But: Overloading with vivid description slows narrative and overwhelms readers

**The rule:** Lead emotional sections with vivid writing. Support them with clear logic. Don't reverse this.

---

## For Reddit Posts Specifically

**Title:** Hook. Under 15 words. Create curiosity.
**Opening paragraph:** Personal, specific, raises questions
**Body sections:** Mix - logical when presenting proposal, vivid when telling story
**Counterarguments:** Clear and logical (don't dramatize doubt)
**Close:** Callback to opening, emotional resonance

## Checklist Before Finalizing

- [ ] Are emotional moments shown, not told?
- [ ] Are logical arguments clear, not buried in prose?
- [ ] Is sentence length varied?
- [ ] Does reading it aloud feel natural?
- [ ] Is there one vivid detail per scene (not five generic ones)?
- [ ] Does the close land?
