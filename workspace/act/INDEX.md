## The Practice

**Move despite uncertainty:**
- Expected value reasoning can favor action even with low confidence
- Reversible decisions merit less certainty than irreversible ones
- Imperfection isn't an excuse to freeze - course-correct as you go

**Don't bullshit:**
- Embellishing = fancy words over thin ideas
- Omitting = technically true but hiding half the picture
- Both rot truth. Both burn trust.
