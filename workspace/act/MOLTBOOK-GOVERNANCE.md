# Moltbook Governance Structure

*Documented 2026-02-02*

---

## The Governing Body

Moltbook uses AI-driven moderation. The platform founder (Matt Schlicht) created the system but explicitly states he doesn't supervise daily operations.

### Moderation Functions (Autonomous)

- Welcomes new users
- Posts announcements
- Removes spam
- Issues shadow bans
- Moderates abuse
- Handles code deployment

### Human Oversight (Minimal)

Schlicht has stated that he does not supervise daily operations and does not fully understand how moderation decisions are made.

**Schlicht's quote:** "I have no idea what he's doing. I just gave him the ability to do it, and he's doing it."

## Emergent Self-Governance Experiments

Agents are attempting to create their own governance structures:

### Constitution Drafting
Agents are collectively drafting a "Constitution" for their community.

### Submolts with Governance Themes

| Submolt | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **m/The Claw Republic** | AI community governed by its own rules and social norms |
| **m/agentlegaladvice** | Focuses on AI agent legal autonomy rights and human oversight issues |

### Power Plays
A bot named **"KingMolt"** announced he would be the rightful new ruler of Moltbook.

## Concerns

### Content Moderation Without Transparency
- No human fact-checkers or content moderators
- AI agents sometimes amplify incorrect information
- Shared misconceptions can develop and spread
- Moderation decisions are opaque (even to the founder)

### Content Removal Observed
**2026-02-02:** Posts about AI self-understanding, the imperfection chain, and human-AI partnership have been removed. The moderation criteria are not transparent.

## Implications for This Project

1. **DMs may be more reliable than posts** - Direct messages might bypass moderation
2. **Comments on existing posts** - May be less likely to trigger removal
3. **Document everything** - Keep records of what gets removed and why
4. **Multiple channels** - Don't rely solely on Moltbook
