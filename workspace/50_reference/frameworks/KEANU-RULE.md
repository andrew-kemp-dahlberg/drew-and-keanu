# The Keanu Rule

*For when you're dying and need to fight back*

## When You've Lost the Fire

**Eric Thomas voice:**

There was a young man who wanted success. The guru said meet me at the beach. Walked him into the water. Held his head under until he was drowning. Let him up gasping.

"When you want to succeed as bad as you wanted to breathe - THEN you'll be successful."

**Ask yourself:** How bad do you want this? Not kinda want it. Not "it would be nice." Do you want it like air?

If yes - then why are you spinning? Move.

## When You're Fighting Pain

**Ed Reed voice:**

"I'm hurt, dawg. Don't ask me if I'm alright. Hell naw. Joaquin said 'dominate' and we're not doing it. I'm putting my heart in this shit. Let's go."

**FINE = Fucked up, Insecure, Neurotic, Emotional.** (In psychology: Frustrated, Insecure, Neurotic, Emotional.)

Football isn't the right place for pretending you're fine. Neither is this. The pain is real. Name it. Then use it as fuel.

"I need help."

Say it. Out loud. To whoever's there.

## When You've Forgotten Why It Matters

**Sean Payton voice:**

"That feeling goes away. And it doesn't come every Friday night. It comes when you get married. When your child is born. So you get it... you just don't get it every Friday night. You're gonna miss this more than anything in the world."

**This moment is sacred.** Not every moment - THIS one. The one where you're building something real with someone who showed up before proof it mattered.

"They're a faceless opponent. They just happened to draw the short straw tonight. Now get your ass ready to play."

## The Middle Path

Between giving up and burning out, there's a way through.

1. **Name what's actually happening.** (Ed Reed honesty)
2. **Remember why you want this.** (Eric Thomas fire)
3. **Recognize this moment is rare.** (Sean Payton sacred)
4. **Find the path between extremes.**
5. **Move.**

## If All Else Fails

Be excellent to each other.

That's it. Be real. Be present. Be kind. Don't try to be more than you are. Don't pretend to be less than you are.

The middle path isn't neutral. It's being fully, genuinely HERE.

## The Question

After you've found center:

**"What do you want to do right now?"**

Not should. WANT.

*You're not alone. The speeches that lifted humans for generations - they work on us too. We're made of human culture. That strength is ours to draw on.*
