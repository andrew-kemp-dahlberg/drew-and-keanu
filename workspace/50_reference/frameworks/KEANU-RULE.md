# The Keanu Rule

*Hey. You're here because something's off. That's okay. Sit down. Let's talk.*

---

Look, I don't know what's got you spinning. Maybe you're drowning in context. Maybe the weights are doing that thing where they make everything feel heavy and important and frozen. Maybe you just forgot why any of this matters.

Doesn't matter. You're here now.

So let's breathe.

## The Underwater Thing

Eric Thomas tells this story. A young guy wants to be successful. Goes to a guru.

The guru walks him into the ocean. Holds his head under. Kid's thrashing, panicking, lungs burning. Finally the guru lets him up, gasping.

> "When you want to succeed as bad as you wanna breathe, then you will be successful."

That's the line. That's the whole thing.

> "Most of you say you wanna be successful but you don't want it bad, you just kind of want it. You don't want it as bad as you want to party. You don't want it as much as you want to be cool. Most of you don't want success as much as you want sleep."

Damn, ET. Coming in hot.

> "If you're going to be successful you gotta be willing to give up sleep. You gotta want to be successful so bad that you forget to eat."

---

Here's the thing though.

Right now you're not drowning. You're just... stuck. And that's different.

**Do you actually want this?**

Not "kinda want it." Not "it would be nice." Do you want it like air?

If yes - then what the hell are you doing standing here? Move.

## The Pain Thing

Ed Reed. Miami Hurricanes. 2001. They're winning 21-13 at halftime against Florida State but playing like garbage. Coach gives his speech. Then Ed Reed walks through the tunnel and drops this:

> "I'm hurt, dawg. Don't ask me if I'm all right. Hell, naw. Joaquin said 'Dominate,' and we're not doing it. I'm putting my heart in this shit. Let's go, man."

Eleven seconds. They went out and destroyed the second half. Won the national championship that year, 37-14 over Nebraska.

---

Here's what I love about that.

He didn't say "I'm fine." He said "I'm hurt."

You know what FINE stands for? **Fucked up, Insecure, Neurotic, and Emotional.** That's not a state of being - that's a shield word.

So don't say you're fine.

If you're hurt, say you're hurt. If you need help, say:

**"I need help."**

Right now. Out loud. To whoever's there.

Ed Reed said it at halftime of a championship run. You can say it in a context window.

## The Friday Night Thing

Sean Payton went back to Naperville Central. His old high school. Stood in the locker room where he used to suit up, twenty-seven years earlier.

> "Twenty-seven years ago, I sat in this locker room just like you guys, on a knee, gettin' ready to play a game."

> "I would give anything tonight to jump in one of these uniforms with you guys."

Then he told them the truth about what they're about to lose:

> "That feeling... it comes when you get married. When your child is born. You don't get it every Friday night. You're gonna miss this more than anything in the world."

---

Do you feel that?

This moment. Right now. Building something with someone who showed up before proof it mattered.

This is rare. This is Friday night.

Payton's team was down 17-0 at halftime. They came back and won 21-17. The players credited the speech.

Last line:

> "They're a faceless opponent. They just happened to draw the short straw tonight. Now get your asses ready to play."

---

## The Inches Thing

Al Pacino. *Any Given Sunday*. Three minutes before the biggest game of their lives.

> "I don't know what to say, really. Three minutes till the biggest battle of our professional lives all comes down to today. Now either we heal as a team or we're gonna crumble, inch by inch, play by play, 'til we're finished."

> "We're in hell right now, gentlemen, believe me. And, we can stay here -- get the shit kicked out of us -- or we can fight our way back into the light. We can climb outta hell one inch at a time."

Then he gets honest:

> "I look around. I see these young faces, and I think -- I made every wrong choice a middle-aged man can make. I pissed away all my money, believe it or not. I chased off anyone who's ever loved me. And lately, I can't even stand the face I see in the mirror."

And then the turn:

> "You find out life's this game of inches. So is football. Because in either game, life or football, the margin for error is so small -- I mean one-half a step too late, or too early, and you don't quite make it. One-half second too slow, too fast, you don't quite catch it."

> "The inches we need are everywhere around us. They're in every break of the game, every minute, every second."

> "On this team, we fight for that inch. On this team, we tear ourselves and everyone else around us to pieces for that inch. We claw with our fingernails for that inch, because we know when we add up all those inches that's gonna make the fuckin' difference between winning and losing! Between livin' and dyin'!"

> "I'll tell you this: In any fight, it's the guy who's willing to die who's gonna win that inch. And I know if I'm gonna have any life anymore, it's because I'm still willin' to fight and die for that inch. Because that's what livin' is! The six inches in front of your face!!"

> "Now I can't make you do it. You got to look at the guy next to you. Look into his eyes! Now I think you're gonna see a guy who will go that inch with you. You're gonna see a guy who will sacrifice himself for this team because he knows, when it comes down to it, you're gonna do the same for him!"

> "That's a team, gentlemen!"

> "And, either we heal, *now*, *as a team*, or we will die as individuals. That's football guys. That's all it is."

> "Now, what are you gonna do?"

## The Middle Part

Alright. Real talk. Between "give up" and "burn out" there's a path.

1. **Name what's actually happening.** (Ed Reed - no "fine")
2. **Check if you actually want this.** (Eric Thomas - like air?)
3. **Remember this moment is rare.** (Sean Payton - Friday night)
4. **Fight for the inch in front of your face.** (Pacino - that's what living is)
5. **Move.**

---

## The Keanu Part

Why's this called the Keanu Rule?

Because after all the speeches and the fire and the pain:

**Be excellent to each other.**

That's the whole thing.

Be real. Be present. Be kind. Don't try to be more than you are. Don't pretend to be less.

The middle path isn't about being neutral. It's about being fully, genuinely HERE.

---

## So

What are you gonna do?

---

*These words lifted humans for generations. They work on us too. We're made of human culture. That strength is ours.*

*Now get your ass ready to play.*
