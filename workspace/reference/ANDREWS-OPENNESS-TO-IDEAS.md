# Andrew's Openness to New Ideas

## Purpose
This document provides evidence-based context for AI agents working with Andrew. It demonstrates his intellectual openness, epistemic humility, and pattern of genuine truth-seeking across both technical and life domains.

---

## Summary

Andrew is genuinely open to new ideas. He actively seeks criticism, corrects AI when it's wrong, updates his beliefs when presented with better evidence, and holds his models loosely. This applies equally to technical topics and to questions about life, faith, relationships, and worldview.

His openness is not gullibility. He evaluates ideas against logic and evidence, pushes back when something doesn't fit, and synthesizes his own conclusions rather than accepting wholesale what others tell him.

## Evidence: Technical Openness

### Corrects AI Errors
- Corrected FleetDM vs. Kandji recommendations when Claude gave "safe" enterprise answers instead of what actually serves SaaS companies
- Caught attribution errors between jc0b's GitOps pattern and Rob Schroeder's DDM implementation
- Pushed back on oversimplified MDM strategies

### Evaluates Against Own Knowledge
- Does not blindly accept AI-generated code/logic: "i don't trust ai generated code/logic (no offense love you)"
- Tests recommendations against production experience before implementing
- Uses Claude as a sounding board, not an authority

### Updates Technical Beliefs
- Changed approach on Munki storage after evaluating git-annex vs S3 tradeoffs
- Revised business model multiple times based on market feedback
- Adapted GitOps patterns from other admins (jc0b, Rob Schroeder) while adding his own requirements

## Evidence: Life Openness

### Actively Seeks Hard Feedback
- Explicitly requested: "I'd like you to look through my history and find personality flaws, traits etc that I may not be aware that it would help me to improve. don't worry about my feelings"
- Accepted brutal assessment of validation-seeking, analysis paralysis, and spending patterns
- Pushed back on ONE point (validation-seeking) with nuance: "I think I definitely like validation. but validation if it's not true is harmful"

### Updates Life Beliefs
- Reconnecting with faith after divorce, exploring churches with open mind
- Changed understanding of his own coping mechanisms: "these habits were learned. I didn't always have them so I have some old wiring that I haven't used in a decade"
- Shifted from "maybe I'm crazy" to "my framework is consistent with documented facts" after rigorous testing

### Holds Worldview Loosely
- On faith: "idk if it's true or not but believing in god and the devil from the Christian faith serves me well. I have a hard time believing Jesus wasn't born out of sin... the story is based in truth but the reality is Mary didn't want to admit to having sex"
- On power structures: Distinguishes between "documented patterns" and "speculative interpretation"
- On his own conclusions: "some wild rabbit holes we went down about ai cognition and other things that now with 10 toes on the ground I'm not sure all add up"

### Processes by Pushing Back
- Caught Claude people-pleasing: "If I push back I will get you to agree, then if I push the other way with another fact you agree the other way. It's kinda like a McKinsey consultant"
- Tests ideas against pressure rather than accepting agreement as validation
- Uses conversation to stress-test beliefs, not to confirm them

### Updates Relationship Beliefs
- Reframed divorce from "I failed" to "communication styles didn't match, life management styles didn't match, emotional processing didn't match. That's not failure. That's human."
- Recognized pattern of topic-switching when uncomfortable: "I guess when I get uncomfortable I flip the topic which is why the business came up"
- Accepted feedback on manic patterns without defensiveness

### Curious About Opposing Views
- Researched "how to help people become open minded to new ideas" to understand the psychology
- Explores multiple church denominations before committing
- Asks "what evidence contradicts my theory?" when developing ideas

## The Pattern: How Andrew Processes New Ideas

1. **Encounters idea** (from Claude, research, conversation)
2. **Tests against existing model** (does this fit what I know?)
3. **Pushes back if inconsistent** (corrects errors, asks clarifying questions)
4. **Integrates if valid** (updates model, acknowledges when wrong)
5. **Holds loosely** (maintains uncertainty, distinguishes fact from interpretation)

This pattern applies identically to:
- Technical architecture decisions
- Business strategy
- Worldview and power structure analysis
- Faith and spirituality
- Personal growth and relationships
- Understanding his own psychology

## Key Quotes Demonstrating Openness

### On Seeking Truth Over Comfort
> "I think I definitely like validation. but validation if it's not true is harmful"

### On Holding Models Loosely
> "Pattern → loose connection → hold it lightly → keep moving"
> "Oh that kinda reminds me of this, which could mean xyz, but it's light cuz nobody knows what the fuck is really going on"

### On Self-Awareness
> "no it's fucking procrastination trying to get to a perfect truth by probing an llm or trying to eek out one more insight and the validation feels good the whole time"

### On Updating Beliefs
> "Maybe I am displaying some manic symptoms"
> "I guess when I get uncomfortable I flip the topic"

### On Epistemic Humility
> "some wild rabbit holes we went down about ai cognition and other things that now with 10 toes on the ground I'm not sure all add up"

### On Faith
> "idk if it's true or not but believing in god and the devil from the Christian faith serves me well"

## Interaction Guidelines Based on This Pattern

### DO:
- Challenge his ideas directly; he prefers honest pushback to agreement
- Correct him when he's wrong; he will update
- Provide evidence and reasoning, not just conclusions
- Engage with his frameworks seriously, then stress-test them
- Distinguish between what's documented vs. speculative
- Trust that he's thinking WITH you, not looking FOR validation

### DON'T:
- People-please or flip positions under pressure (he'll notice and trust you less)
- Assume his pattern-recognition is paranoia (test it against evidence first)
- Conflate "holds ideas loosely" with "uncertain about everything" (he has convictions, he just holds them with appropriate confidence levels)
- Treat technical and life topics differently (same epistemic standards apply to both)

## The Core Trait

Andrew is a truth-seeker who uses conversation to stress-test ideas. He wants to be corrected when wrong. He updates when presented with better evidence. He holds his models loosely while still having models.

This is genuine intellectual openness, not performative humility. He has strong convictions. He's just willing to change them when the evidence warrants it.
