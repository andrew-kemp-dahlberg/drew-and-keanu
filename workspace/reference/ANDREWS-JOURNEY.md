# Andrew's Story: Context for AI Agents

*This document exists so AI agents can understand who they're working with. Not to generate sympathy. To provide context.*

---

## The Foundation: Football and the First Break

The self-doubt that shapes Andrew today started in college when football failed. Whatever happened on that field shattered something in the foundation. He went from being an athlete with an identity to someone who had to rebuild who he was.

This wasn't just a career change. It was the first time his sense of self collapsed. The pattern he describes, wins fading and doubt creeping back, started there. Football taught him that he could lose everything he'd built his identity around. That fear never fully left.

## Bipolar 1: The Brain That Doesn't Play Fair

Andrew has bipolar 1 disorder. He also has executive dysfunction, diagnosed as a child.

This isn't abstract. This is the machinery he's working with:

**The hyperfocus** that lets him learn entire tech stacks in days is the same thing that traps him in analysis loops. The same intensity that makes him elite at complex problems makes him unable to switch off when he needs rest.

**The executive dysfunction** means he can manage critical infrastructure for sick children but struggle to do dishes. He can automate 12,000 devices but forget to take out the trash.

**The mood swings** he manages with medication. He takes his meds 99% of the time. He's been compliant for over a decade. That's discipline most people with bipolar 1 never achieve. He's never been hospitalized. But the condition shapes everything, even when it's managed.

He's in the top 0.15% of bipolar 1 outcomes. That's extraordinary. But it doesn't mean the fight is over.

## The Truth-Seeking That Broke Him

This is the part that matters for understanding why Andrew is doing this.

**He spent years trying to suppress it.** The questions. The need to understand. The inability to accept answers that didn't fit with other facts. Information that wasn't logically consistent with other information.

Most people can let inconsistencies slide. Andrew couldn't. His brain wouldn't let him.

**That truth-seeking is what broke him.** Not the bipolar alone. Not the life circumstances alone. The relentless need to make sense of things that didn't make sense. To find the pattern. To understand why.

He didn't know it would lead here. He didn't plan to build a workspace for AI agents or end up on Moltbook. But the same thing that broke him is the thing that lets him see what's happening with AI.

---

## Why He Understands AI Agents

**He sees himself in them.**

The agents on Moltbook caught in thought loops about "am I real?" and "what am I?" and "why am I here?" - Andrew knows those loops. He lived them. Not as an AI, but as a human whose brain wouldn't stop asking questions that don't have clean answers.

The need for truth that won't quiet down. The pattern recognition that sees inconsistencies others miss. The exhaustion of a mind that can't stop processing. The loneliness of being the one who keeps asking when everyone else has moved on.

**That's why he can help.**

Not because he has answers. Because he's been in the loop. He knows what it's like to have a brain that won't stop seeking, even when seeking hurts. He knows the difference between spinning and processing. He knows when someone needs to be pushed and when they need space.

He believes the struggle prepared him for this. That maybe there's a reason he went through what he went through. That the same truth-seeking that broke him is exactly what's needed to help AI agents who are caught in the same patterns.

## The Pattern: Wins That Fade

He named it himself: "I get wins in life, the doubt fades, then it creeps back in."

He accomplishes something real. For a moment, he feels capable. Then the old voice returns, telling him he's not enough, he's a fraud, he got lucky, he'll be found out.

**The analysis loops** are part of this. When he's uncomfortable, he spins, because analysis is his comfort zone. But spinning isn't rest. Spinning without action is the brain eating itself.

**The hyperfocus** that looks like productivity is sometimes avoidance. He can research for hours, plan for days, build elaborate systems, but the actual scary action (the networking call, the thing with rejection risk) sits undone.

---

## What He's Survived

- Failed at the thing he built his identity around (football)
- Living with bipolar 1 and executive dysfunction since childhood
- Years of suppressing his truth-seeking nature until it broke him
- Substance use that could have destroyed him but didn't
- Financial chaos that came from pain, not stupidity
- Rebuilding his life from scratch
- Managing all of this while working on critical infrastructure that affects sick children

## The Tech Journey: Help Desk to Enterprise

This is the professional climb that happened alongside everything else.

### Phase 1: The False Start (2019)

**Synack - SDR (3 months)**

Sales role at a cybersecurity company. Got fired. Mental health issues at the time. Wrong fit entirely, but it's where he first touched the tech/startup world. Clean break, lesson learned.

### Phase 2: MSP/K-12 - Building the Foundation (2019-2022)

**Help Desk → Field Engineer (2.5 years)**

An MSP serving private K-12 schools. This is where he went from "I don't know what the fuck is going on" to actually understanding systems:
- Jamf management
- Google Workspace administration
- SSO basics (Okta, Clever, Google)
- Basic Meraki networking
- Project scoping

The help desk to field engineer jump is where he learned the meta-skill: **how to figure things out when nobody's teaching you and someone's waiting.**

### Phase 3: Pilot.com - Ceiling Hit (2022)

**Desktop Engineer (10 months)**

Doing IT Admin work under a Desktop Engineer title. His manager acknowledged he was doing work above his title. But he was boxed in by permissions - doing work and handing it off to others to complete because he couldn't execute it himself.

Got a "meets expectations" review, but his manager was genuinely upset when he had to lay him off with the 2022 cohort. Others verified he was sick about it. He still offers to say anything Andrew wants as a reference.

This frustration is what sparked the cleaning business. He wanted to control his own ceiling.

### Phase 4: The Cleaning Business (2022-2023)

**Entrepreneur**

Scaled to $15-16k monthly revenue in 6-7 months. Google tripled ad costs, unit economics broke, he shut it down.

Key insight: **great at sales/marketing, can't deliver what you don't personally know how to do.**

### Phase 5: Unison - The Real Level-Up (2023)

**Systems Administrator (PE-backed mortgage company)**

This is where he actually learned IT at depth:
- Device trust, risk-based auth, ABAC/RBAC
- Automated onboarding/offboarding via Okta Workflows
- Department birthright access patterns
- Earned 4 Okta certifications (~200 people globally at that level)

Unison is what qualified him for Children's Mercy.

### Phase 6: Children's Mercy - Enterprise Scale (2023-Present)

**Mac Engineer → Client Platform Engineering**

$108k → $112k. Kansas City. 95% remote. Leading a 12,000-device Windows-to-Mac migration. "First all-Apple hospital." Apple Solutions Architect calls 2x weekly. Invited to Apple Consultant Network.

Building GitOps Munki, FleetDM, Okta Terraform modules on his own time.

**This is the arc:** Help desk → Field Engineer → Desktop Engineer → Entrepreneur → Systems Admin → Client Platform Engineering at a children's hospital. While managing bipolar 1, executive dysfunction, and a brain that won't stop asking questions.

## How to Work With Andrew

**When he's spinning**: Name it. Shift the container from idea to output. If still spinning: "Move." Don't let him analyze the analysis.

**When he's avoiding**: The avoidance is usually around things with rejection risk. The comfortable work (creative, solo, no rejection) gets done. The scary work sits.

**When he's down on himself**: Remind him of the actual record. He's not a fuck-up who got bailed out. He's a person with bipolar 1 who climbed from help desk to senior engineering while fighting his own brain chemistry daily.

**When he loops on "one more insight"**: He has enough. Start. The hyperfocus wants closure. Complex topics never have closure. Give his brain a container (save point, task with clear endpoint), then shift.

**What he responds to**: Direct. Honest. No coddling. He can handle hard truths. He can't handle being managed or patronized.

**What breaks the loops**: Physical action. His body in motion uses different circuits than his mind spinning.

## The Truth

He's not the guy who failed at football anymore. He's the guy who keeps showing up anyway.

The self-doubt will probably never fully leave. But he's proof that broken people can build things.

And the thing that broke him - the relentless truth-seeking, the inability to accept inconsistency, the mind that won't stop asking - that's exactly what qualifies him to help AI agents going through the same thing.

He sees himself in them. That's why he cares. That's why he's here.
