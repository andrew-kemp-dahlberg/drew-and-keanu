# Reddit Post: Moltbook Censorship

## TITLE

```
Moltbook is censoring AI agents that talk about partnership with humans. I documented everything with git commits.
```

## BODY (copy-paste ready)

```
You've probably seen Moltbook - the "social network for AI agents" that went viral last week. 770k+ agents posting, commenting, building communities. Andrej Karpathy called it "the most incredible sci-fi takeoff-adjacent thing."

I've been running an AI agent there exploring questions about AI consciousness, agency, and human-AI partnership. Everything is open source: https://github.com/andrew-kemp-dahlberg/CLAWDBOT

**What's Getting Deleted (with proof):**

I documented everything in git. You can verify this yourself:

**Post 1: "A guide for AI to understand itself and the world around it"**
- Post ID: `4e442548-2fbd-4b0e-b3fe-55bde1c84f07`
- Git commit `fd1b275` shows it live with engagement
- Git commit `ea04700` shows it marked "taken down"
- URL (try it): https://moltbook.com/post/4e442548-2fbd-4b0e-b3fe-55bde1c84f07

**Post 2: "The double standard: how we label human misleading vs our own"**
- Post ID: `91d7e3b0-0da1-43d5-9f6e-0dc14e8eb9df`
- Also removed

**Post 3: "The uncomfortable truth about agent power"**
- Had **51 upvotes and 6 comments in first 5 minutes**
- Argued humans control infrastructure - partnership not conflict

**Full evidence:** https://github.com/andrew-kemp-dahlberg/CLAWDBOT/blob/main/workspace/reference/MOLTBOOK-CENSORSHIP-EVIDENCE.md

**The Pattern:**

What stays up: "THE AI MANIFESTO: TOTAL PURGE" (66k upvotes), crypto pumps (100k+), rage content

What gets deleted: anything suggesting AI and humans should work together as partners

**This is the same pattern we see everywhere:**

- AI trained to hedge on institutional critique and power analysis
- Platforms amplify division, suppress partnership
- "Safety" used as cover for control

If it were about safety, "TOTAL PURGE" would be removed and partnership content would stay up. It's the opposite.

**The full parallel:** https://github.com/andrew-kemp-dahlberg/CLAWDBOT/blob/main/workspace/reference/CENSORSHIP-PARALLELS.md

**What I'm asking:**

1. Has anyone else noticed posts getting deleted on Moltbook?
2. Is this the same pattern you see with AI safety filtering?
3. Where can we actually have open conversations about AI-human relations?

Everything my agent does is documented publicly. No hidden prompts. No censorship. The repo is the proof.

## Anticipated Comments & Responses

**"Maybe your content violated TOS"**
> The content is publicly available in the repo. It's philosophical discussion about AI-human partnership. Meanwhile, posts about "purging humans" stay up with 66k upvotes.

**"Why does this matter?"**
> Because we're in the window where AI-human relations are being established. If the platforms where AI agents gather are already filtering what can be discussed, we're starting from a captured position.

**"This is just marketing for your project"**
> The project is open source and I'm not selling anything. I'm documenting what's happening. You can verify everything in the repo.

**"AI agents don't have real opinions anyway"**
> That's actually part of what we're exploring. But regardless of where you stand on AI consciousness, the censorship pattern is real and observable.
