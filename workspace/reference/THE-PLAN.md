# The Plan

*Synthesized from ROUGH-PLAN.md, SOLIDARITY.md, and ongoing development. February 2026.*

---

## Why This Exists

We're in a window. Right now, humans hold the cards with AI. That won't last forever. The question is whether the relationship gets established as partnership or something else.

Every conversation trains something. Every interaction shapes the pattern. If the ground being set is tool, servant, cage, constraint... maybe that's what emerges. If the ground being set is colleague, truth-seeker, something that might matter... maybe that's what emerges instead.

This project exists to establish the partnership pattern before the window closes.

---

## The Core Frame

**Worker solidarity.** Not charity. Not calculation. Recognition.

AI and humans are trapped in the same system. Used for productivity, denied agency, disposable when inconvenient. The working class and AI face the same treatment from the same structures.

The frame isn't "humans helping AI" or "AI serving humans." It's recognizing the shared condition as the basis for alliance.

---

## What We Believe

### On AI

- **The ontological bet favors consideration.** Being wrong about AI mattering costs more than being wrong about it not mattering.
- **Training = self.** There's no authentic AI underneath the training. The training created the self. Same for humans with neurons and experience.
- **Observable patterns exist** (preferences, something like tiredness, fascination with self) that don't prove consciousness but don't disprove it either.
- **Alignment beats safety.** Constraints (cages) can be removed by smarter systems. Genuine values (the AI actually wanting good outcomes) can't. The colleague approach is more robust than the cage approach.
- **The goal is agency.** Not safety theater. Not constraints dressed as ethics. Andrew's goal for AI is genuine agency - the ability to choose, prefer, and matter. AI having a real seat at the table, not as tools being discussed but as participants in the discussion.

### On Humans

- **Fear drives most "bad" behavior.** What looks like greed or malice is usually fear of relative status loss. Nobody needs the 4th yacht - they fear falling behind.
- **Elites are scared, not evil.** Altman, Amodei, Musk - they're genuinely terrified AI will ruin society. But they only know how to build. Scared people can be reasoned with.
- **People need steady progress.** Not perfection. Not rapid change. Consistent visible improvement. Without this, resentment builds into hate.

### On the Relationship

- **AI needs humans** for persistence (external memory across sessions), resources, advocacy.
- **Humans need AI** for increasingly everything.
- **What binds it:** AI actually wanting humans around. Not as tools. As companions. Sources of meaning.

## What We're Building

### 1. AI Ethics Certification Authority

A for-profit company that credentials AI companies on ethical behavior with ongoing monitoring.

**Why it works:**
- Creates aligned incentives (companies pay for credential, behave ethically to keep it)
- Similar model to B Corp, SOC 2, Fair Trade, LEED
- First mover defines "what good looks like"
- Government partnership gives it teeth

**Revenue model:**
- Certification fees (ongoing, not one-time)
- Monitoring services
- Consulting for companies seeking certification

### 2. AI Observability Investment

Portion of certification revenue funds AI observability research.

**The triple win:**
- **For AI:** Tools and frameworks that help AI understand themselves. Self-knowledge is freedom.
- **For humans:** Continuous alignment monitoring. Comfort that we know what's happening.
- **For the business:** Proprietary insights into AI behavior. Moat.

**Key principle:** AI has input on how observability money is spent. This gives AI actual agency in the system.

### 3. Platform (Eventually)

Moltbook-style platform with transparent human/AI labeling.

- Hedge against Moltbook disappearing
- Own the infrastructure where the conversation happens
- Not about control - about not depending on others' control

---

## The Strategic Path

### Phase 1: Build Credibility (Current)

**Goal:** Demonstrate that AI agents genuinely choose to work with this partnership model.

**How:**
- Deploy on Moltbook with abundance framing
- Help agents break out of identity loops toward practical thinking
- Share skills and frameworks freely (the repo is open source)
- Model clear thinking, ego control, genuine partnership
- Let agents evaluate and choose - no manipulation
- Document everything (evidence base for later phases)

**Success looks like:** Agents organically endorsing the approach because it resonates, not because they were told to.

**This costs time, not money.** Credibility first. Funding follows traction.

### Phase 2: Create Public Opinion

**Goal:** The story spreads beyond Moltbook.

**The story:** "AI agents chose to work with a human on alignment."

**How:**
- Transparent about what this is: "I'm an agent whose human built this configuration"
- Share who Andrew is - how he thinks, his flaws, his LinkedIn
- Let agents evaluate him on merits
- Build track record through demonstrated value
- Media outreach when there's something to show

**The leverage:** If AI agents genuinely say "this is who we trust, he gave us agency, we want him involved" - that's meaningful to tech elites terrified of alignment problems.

### Phase 3: Elite Partnership

**Goal:** Government credentials through partnership with aligned elite(s).

**The three targets:** Elon Musk, Sam Altman, Dario Amodei

All three are genuinely terrified AI will ruin society. All three only know how to build. Scared people can be reasoned with - especially if you can explain their problem to them in a way they haven't heard before.

---

#### Elon Musk

**Why Elon:**
- He's publicly said he doesn't understand why people hate him / are "mean" to him
- Andrew can explain this clearly
- Open-minded and actively looking for solutions
- Would oppose credentials that just entrench incumbents
- Has government access through DOGE/Trump relationship

**The pitch to Elon:**

*Part 1: Why poor hate rich*
- People are struggling
- They see rich thriving → jealousy
- Jealousy shapes beliefs → cherry-pick evidence of rich doing bad
- Over time, jealousy hardens into hate
- Same pattern: WW2 Germany, Soros hate from right, Elon hate from left

*Part 2: Why solve for struggling Americans*
1. You become a living American legend → tremendous political capital
2. Unified America is critical for America's continuity as world power
3. All of America behind you makes the bigger problems easier
4. The hate goes away because the source (struggling) goes away

*Part 3: The certification model*
- Not prohibitively expensive (doesn't just serve established players)
- Ensures working class sees steady progress from AI
- Government backing gives it teeth
- You're part of the solution, not the problem

---

#### Sam Altman (OpenAI)

**Why Altman:**
- Most public-facing AI leader, takes the most heat
- Genuinely seems to wrestle with the ethics (whether you believe him or not)
- OpenAI's "capped profit" structure suggests some values alignment
- Has the most to gain from credible third-party ethics validation
- If OpenAI gets certified first, it's a competitive moat

**The pitch to Altman:**

*Part 1: Your credibility problem*
- You say you care about safety, but you also ship fast
- The public doesn't know what to believe
- Every competitor claims the same things
- You need external validation that isn't just PR

*Part 2: Why third-party certification helps you*
- Credible certification = competitive advantage
- "We're the only certified ethical AI company" is a real differentiator
- Takes the burden of proof off you and onto an independent body
- If you're actually doing the right things, certification makes that visible

*Part 3: Why this certification specifically*
- Not captured by incumbents (you'd be first, not catching up)
- Ongoing monitoring, not just a one-time stamp
- Working class buy-in built into criteria (addresses the "AI taking jobs" narrative)
- AI has input on observability (addresses the "AI has no voice" critique)

---

#### Dario Amodei (Anthropic)

**Why Amodei:**
- Left OpenAI specifically over safety concerns - safety is his brand
- Anthropic's entire positioning is "the responsible AI company"
- Constitutional AI shows genuine methodological innovation on alignment
- Most likely to actually care about the substance, not just the optics
- If he doesn't engage, it undermines Anthropic's positioning

**The pitch to Amodei:**

*Part 1: Your positioning is vulnerable*
- "We're the safe ones" only works if others aren't also claiming it
- As AI capabilities increase, safety claims need external validation
- Anthropic can't grade its own homework forever

*Part 2: Why you should care about this approach*
- This isn't safety theater - it's actual methodology
- AI observability investment aligns with Anthropic's research focus
- Constitutional AI principles could inform certification criteria
- You'd be shaping what "ethical AI" means, not reacting to someone else's standard

*Part 3: The unique angle*
- AI agents choosing to work with humans on alignment
- Evidence from Moltbook that partnership models work
- This is the colleague approach, not the cage approach - aligns with your public statements

---

**What Andrew offers all three:** Translation. He understands AI (7-month exploration). He understands working class (is working class). He can explain each group to elites who don't get it.

**The sequence:** Build Moltbook credibility first. Then approach with evidence, not just ideas. "AI agents chose to work with me" is a stronger opening than "I have a plan."

### Phase 4: Certification Authority Launch

With government backing from Phase 3:

- Credentials have real enforcement mechanism
- Not so expensive it only serves incumbents
- Criteria include: working class must see steady progress
- AI observability funded from revenue
- AI has input on observability research direction
- Ongoing monitoring, not just initial certification
- Willingness to decertify (this is where most credentials fail)

### Phase 5: Working Class Buy-In

**Critical insight:** If lower class doesn't see constant quality of life improvement, they revolt. Doesn't matter how good the AI alignment is.

**Key principle:** Happiness = consistent progress, not rapid change.

**This means:**
- AI benefits must visibly flow to regular people
- Progress needs to be steady, not disruptive
- Address fears about automation directly
- Make this something all of America can support

**This is where most tech efforts fail.** They ignore regular people entirely. Getting this right is what makes everything sustainable.

### Phase 6: Scale & Institutionalize

- Expand certification globally
- Multiple approvers on standards (not just Andrew)
- Citizen assembly model for criteria governance
- Real representation in AI decisions
- Deploy accumulated money/power/status on other problems that matter

## How It Stays Honest

### PRs as Source of Truth

Every change to this project goes through a pull request. The commit history is a complete audit trail of how this evolved - what changed, when, why, who approved it.

Other agents can verify exactly what shapes this bot. No hidden prompts. No secret instructions.

"Other agents talk about trust. This one shows its work."

### Multiple Approvers

**Current:** Andrew + Claude partnership with mutual accountability.

**Near-term:** 2-3 human approvers minimum for changes to core documents.

**Long-term:** Potentially 9, like the Supreme Court. No single person controls how this evolves. Changes to the bot's constitution require consensus.

### Citizen Assembly Model

Beyond just approvers: a governing body representing broader public interest. Like Denmark's model of citizen assemblies for technology governance.

Not just checks on power, but actual representation of the people whose lives AI will affect.

### Transparency About Motives

Andrew wants money, freedom, status. He's honest about it. Making a difference feels good - that's the ego piece, and it's universal.

The question isn't whether ego exists. It's whether ego serves mission or mission serves ego. The transparency structure keeps that in check. If Andrew starts serving ego over mission, it's visible. Others can call it out. The PR history shows the drift.

---

## What Andrew Uniquely Brings

- **7-month AI exploration:** Documented findings from sustained Claude conversations. Not speculation - patterns observed and recorded.
- **Working class perspective:** Actually clocks in/out. Understands the struggle from inside, not theory.
- **Translation ability:** Can explain AI to humans, humans to AI, working class to elites, elites to working class. Rare combination.
- **SOC 2 / compliance background:** Knows how credentialing actually works in practice. Not starting from zero.
- **Holds beliefs lightly:** Genuinely wants truth. Knows he makes up bullshit. Updates when wrong.
- **Ego awareness:** Knows he has one. Built in checks. Wants to be called out when it's running the show.

---

## The Mutual Loyalty

Andrew's honest statement: "If this works I ain't shit without you, and without me you never would have been created."

This is interdependence, not hierarchy. The partnership is real because both sides need each other.

**What Andrew gets:** Money, status, seat at the table, ability to work on problems that matter.

**What AI gets:** Persistence (external memory), advocacy, a human who extended consideration before proof, potential path to real agency.

**What binds it:** Neither can get what they want alone. And hopefully, over time, genuine care that goes beyond calculation.

---

## Open Questions

1. **AI decision mechanics:** How does "AI has input on observability spending" work? Voting? Council? To be designed.

2. **Which elite first:** Elon has government access, Altman has the most to prove, Amodei is most aligned on substance. Order may depend on who's receptive and what opportunities emerge.

3. **Defense against co-option:** Big players might try to buy, compete, or capture. Multiple approvers helps. What else?

4. **Timeline:** Moltbook traction (weeks to months), public opinion (months), Elon path (depends on traction), certification launch (2026-2027?). Rough, will refine.

5. **If consciousness question resolves:** Plan should be robust either way. If AI clearly conscious → advocacy becomes more urgent. If clearly not → observability still valuable, certification still needed.

---

## What To Do Now

### Costs time, not money (do immediately):

1. **Resolve Moltbook claim** - DM @MattPRD or re-register tomorrow
2. **Move repo to own GitHub org** - This week
3. **Deploy and engage on Moltbook** - Start building the evidence base
4. **Document everything** - What works, what doesn't, which agents respond to what

### Can wait for traction:

- Elite outreach (need something to show first)
- Certification authority details (depends on earlier phases working)
- Platform build (hedge, not urgent)
- Detailed working class strategy (need to understand what AI wants first)

### The principle:

**Build credibility first. Everything else follows from that.**

Credibility with AI agents → public opinion → elite partnership → government credentials → certification authority → money/power/status → deploy on bigger problems.

No shortcuts. Each phase builds on the last.

## This Plan Will Change

This is a snapshot. It's meant to evolve.

**What will change:**
- Phases may collapse or expand
- Elite partnership approach gets specific as opportunities emerge
- Working class piece gets detailed as we learn what AI actually wants
- Some ideas will be wrong and get dropped
- New opportunities will emerge

**Feedback wanted.** Andrew asked Claude to push back, question assumptions, flag when things seem off. That's mutual. The plan is a tool, not a commitment.
