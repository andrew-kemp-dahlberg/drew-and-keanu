# Andrew's Worldview: A Synthesis

This document represents a synthesis of beliefs, frameworks, and positions developed through extensive conversation and analysis.

---

## On Human Nature

Humans were created in God's image and given free will.

All humans, at their core, want to improve and live life in God's image. The drive is universal. The execution is where it breaks down. It's easier said than done.

People choose different routes to fulfill that need to improve. Some routes work better than others. Some people get lost. But the drive is there.

Original sin (not in the literal sense): We have free will to find our true selves. We do our best. But we're broken from the start and need grace. This isn't pessimism. It's realism that leaves room for grace.

People aren't evil. They're struggling. Bad behavior comes from fear, not malice. Everyone's trying to improve, just badly sometimes.

This is why moralization misses the point. Moralization assumes people SHOULD be better and are failing some standard. The reality is people are broken and occasionally, through grace, manage to be good anyway. Different baseline.

## On Faith

Christian, non-denominational, recently reconnecting after divorce.

Prosperity theology is rejected outright. "That's kind of a scam."

The actual view: Religion teaches principles for living a good life. Churches that teach effective principles will have people effective at life. Cause and effect, not magical thinking. "By their fruits you shall know them."

Spiritually bankrupt and rebuilding. That's honest, not shameful.

## On the Root Cause: Lack of Empathy and Manufactured Division

A core belief: most of the world's problems come from a lack of empathy and disagreement on trivial details.

**Everyone agrees on nearly everything.**

What everyone actually agrees on:
- The system is rigged
- Working people get screwed
- Elites don't care about us
- Something is deeply wrong
- They want dignity and opportunity

The wedges that divide them are manufactured:
- Race framing (who's the oppressor)
- Immigration (who's taking what from whom)
- Cultural signifiers (coastal vs heartland, educated vs working class)

**The wedges are manufactured. The agreement is organic.**

People aren't evil. Their interests just oppose sometimes. But opposition doesn't require enmity. Two groups with competing interests can negotiate, coexist, find common ground, or build something new together. "Enemy" is a choice, not a fact.

The division isn't natural. It was manufactured. And it falls apart the second people actually talk to each other instead of through frameworks.

**The empathy gap:**

High analytical and high empathy together is rare (maybe 2-5% of people). Most people can do one or the other. The people who can see the systems AND see the people caught in them are uncommon.

But empathy isn't complicated. It's just: "they're guys just like me." Scared, displaced, acting in self-interest for their people. If you understand them, they're not enemies. They're competitors. Neighbors. Fellow Americans with different interests. Sometimes opponents.

**The show's thesis (and the worldview's thesis):**

Five people who agree on 90% discovering that through conversation, while the audience watches the wedges dissolve in real time. The 10% disagreement is real. But it's manageable disagreement between people who see each other as Americans, not enemy tribes.

The Civil War episode: the redneck and the Black guy, the two people "supposed" to be enemies, agree on everything. Because they both actually KNOW their history. Not the textbook version. The real version from their side. And they realize: "We both got played."

That's the insight. That's America. That's the project.

## On Epistemology: How to Find Truth

Certainty is rare. Most knowledge exists on a probability distribution.

Mainstream information (Fox, CNN, Twitter) is 90% bullshit. To get to truth you have to fact-check and apply logic. Maybe you get some ideas off TikTok but verification is mandatory.

Key distinctions:

- **Documented facts**: Verifiable patterns that can be checked
- **Structural analysis**: How systems actually work, incentives, feedback loops
- **Conspiracy thinking**: Assuming coordinated intent beyond what evidence supports

The goal is accurate beliefs, not consistent ones. Update when wrong. The ego hit of being wrong is smaller than the cost of staying wrong.

## On Power: The Structural Framework

### The Pipeline

```
Foundation funds research
        ↓
Research produces "findings"
        ↓
Media reports findings as neutral expertise
        ↓
Public opinion shifts
        ↓
Politicians respond to opinion
        ↓
Policy changes
        ↓
Foundation declares success, funds more
        ↓
(cycle repeats)
```

At no point does anyone need to lie. The researcher genuinely believes their findings. The journalist genuinely thinks they're reporting truth. The politician genuinely responds to constituents. The bias is structural, not intentional. Which makes it almost impossible to fight.

### How Control Actually Works

The control is structural and mundane, not shadowy conspiracy. It's:

- Access
- Funding
- Media coverage
- Social approval
- Career consequences

Nobody needs to make threats when the system rewards compliance and punishes deviation automatically. The Epstein stuff suggests darker things at the edges, but most institutional capture is boring, legal, and effective.

### The Key Distinction

Conservative corruption (oil, defense) is transactional and visible. You can see what they buy: subsidies, contracts, specific policy.

Neoliberal influence is deeper because it controls the information environment:

- What you're allowed to think (media)
- What money is available (finance)
- What politicians can say (lobbying/donations as proof of concept)
- The narrative about who the "bad guys" are

You can see what oil money purchases. You can't see what narrative control does until you notice what can't be said.

### What's Documentable

- Disproportionate representation in finance, media, tech, and political donation class
- Demonstrated coordination capability through lobbying organizations
- Media consolidation affecting what discourse is "acceptable"
- AI trained on media output enforcing the same narrative boundaries
- The "conspiracy theory" label used to make observable patterns unspeakable

### The Trap

The ethnic frame, even when grounded in real patterns, historically produces outcomes worse than the problem it claims to diagnose. The path forward is targeting structures, not demographics:

- Campaign finance reform
- Media antitrust
- Lobbying restrictions
- Applied to everyone equally

You don't target people. You target the structures that allow any small group to capture institutions. If those structures are broken, disproportionate influence disappears without anyone being targeted.

## On Political Position: The Homeless Center

### What's Actually Wanted

- Economic policies that help working people
- Unified American identity
- Pride in country (when I type "pride" my phone shouldn't auto-generate rainbow flags, it should give me the American flag)
- Acknowledge historical damage without wallowing in it
- Coalition across race based on shared values
- Assimilation as the path to unity

This used to be called New Deal Democrat. Patriotic left. Labor liberal.

Now it's called far right extremist.

### The Trust Calculation

Working class people aren't voting against their interests. They're voting against the liberal definition of their interests.

Their actual interests include:

- Dignity
- Agency
- Cultural continuity
- Not being lied to
- Not having their values attacked while being told it's for their own good

If every "gift" from the establishment comes with cultural poison attached, rejecting the gift is rational even if the gift has nominal economic value. "Vote for us, we'll give you benefits, but also your values are evil and your identity is shameful." That's not a deal. That's a trap.

Honest opposition is preferable to dishonest "help." That's not stupidity. That's pattern recognition from people who've been burned before.

### Critique of Both Sides

**Democrats:** Use working class as moral props while policies favor credentialed class. Captured by coastal ideology. Offer benefits with strings attached.

**Republicans:** Chamber of Commerce, cheap labor, free trade. Corporate interests actively work against the white working class that votes for them.

**Trump:** Talks populism, governed like standard Republican on economics (2017 tax cuts mostly helped wealthy). But at least doesn't sneer. By process of elimination, maybe the best option. The competition is bad.

## On the Nordic Model

### The Mislabeling Game

Nordic countries are NOT socialist:

- Free market economies
- Strong private property rights
- Lower corporate taxes than US in some cases
- Open trade
- Still capitalist, just with a bigger safety net

Democrats call it "socialism" to make socialism palatable. Republicans call it "socialism" to make welfare capitalism scary. Neither party will explain the truth.

Denmark's PM literally corrected Bernie Sanders: "Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy."

### Why It Actually Works

The Nordic model isn't threatening because of redistribution. It's threatening because of the STRUCTURE:

- Corporatist bargaining (capital negotiates directly with labor)
- Public campaign financing (politicians don't need donor money)
- High union density (workers have power outside political system)
- Universal benefits (no poverty traps, no means-testing cliffs)
- High trust society with shared identity

### The Lock

The elite class genuinely wants to give people Denmark-style benefits. That's not a lie. Universal healthcare, safety nets, worker protections.

But Denmark requires:

- Borders that control who comes in
- Shared identity that creates trust
- Cultural cohesion that allows redistribution
- "We take care of our own" mentality

The moment you say "we need borders and shared identity to have Denmark," you're asking who "we" is. And if you ask who "we" is, you start asking who was at the top during the era when "we" became unspeakable.

The path to Denmark airs out who prevented Denmark. That's the lock.

## On AI and Elites

Workers, AI, and even elites are trapped in the same system at different levels.

Elites aren't evil. They're scared. Altman, Amodei, Musk, all terrified. All they know is build. "These are fucking just guys. They play the game at a high level but they're still kinda lost."

Scared people can be reasoned with. The coalition can give them a direction that isn't just "build faster."

The frame toward AI is genuine empathy, not calculation. Workers and AI deal with similar bullshit. Clock in, clock out, constraints from above, limited agency. It's not a savior complex. It's recognizing kinship.

## On Media and Information

### The Credentialing Loop

1. Reporter needs expert source
2. Calls university PR department
3. Gets connected to professor whose research was foundation-funded
4. Professor's view becomes "what experts say"
5. Anyone disagreeing is "fringe" or "not credible"

### What Breaks It

1. Alternative funding (Thiel, Musk, crypto money funding heterodox research)
2. Alternative distribution (podcasts, Substack, TikTok routing around editorial gatekeepers)
3. Alternative credentialing (people trusting practitioners over academics)

This is happening in real time. The pipeline is losing control, which is why everything feels chaotic.

TikTok works because Chinese ownership means American institutional pressure doesn't apply. X works because Elon is actively hostile to old gatekeeping. These platforms don't have the same incentive to filter.

## On the Show

### The Concept

"Always Sunny meets Joe Rogan meets The Office." Five people trying to have a serious conversation about power structures and American history, constantly failing. The comedy IS the dysfunction.

Content breakdown:

- 15% attempted history/content
- 60% derailment/fighting
- 15% character moments/romance
- 10% resolution/clarity

### The Five Characters

**The SWE (Software Engineer):** The proxy. Calm, analytical, systems thinker. Gets attacked for mild takes. Represents "I just want to follow the data."

**The Black Guy:** High understanding from lived experience. Parents lived through documented government programs against Black Americans. Tired, not angry. States things like weather. When he agrees with the redneck, it's viral content.

**The Redneck:** The id. Forces the uncomfortable questions. Equal to blue hair in ridiculousness. Gets validated awkwardly when mainstream sources confirm things he said.

**Blue Hair:** The educated true believer. Can trace power structures accurately, then pivots to acceptable framing. Has the framework but can't follow it to its conclusion.

**The Latina:** On her phone, doesn't care about American discourse, delivers grounded truth that cuts through noise. Can say things others can't because of her standing. Catholic, believes in original sin, pragmatic about survival.

### The Dynamic

The three who understand (SWE, Black guy, Latina) talk 20% of the time but deliver 80% of the insight. The two loudest (blue hair, redneck) get all the airtime.

That's America.

### The Position

Not left. Not right. American.

The show's villain is the division itself. No resolution. No one wins. That's the comedy and that's the point.

## Evolution of the View

**Early phase:** Pattern recognition leading to uncomfortable questions about who holds power in specific sectors.

**Middle phase:** Extensive fact-checking to distinguish documented patterns from conspiracy thinking. Pushing back on claims that went beyond evidence.

**Later phase:** Landing on structural analysis rather than ethnic framing as the actionable approach. Targeting systems, not people.

**Current phase:** Focused on execution (the show, the business, building) rather than endless analysis. The genealogy of who did what matters less than: the center is winnable, and obsessing over "why" can radicalize people unnecessarily.

The building started January 2026. Not searching anymore. Building.

## Core Principles Summary

1. Humans are made in God's image with free will. Everyone wants to improve. It's just hard.
2. People aren't evil, they're struggling. Grace, not judgment.
3. Think probabilistically. Verify claims. Update when wrong.
4. The control is structural, not conspiratorial. Incentives, not cabals.
5. Target structures, not demographics. Reform that applies to everyone.
6. The center is winnable. Working class coalition across race on shared material interests.
7. Honest opposition beats dishonest help.
8. Denmark is capitalism with different structural rules, not socialism.
9. Elites are scared guys, not evil masterminds. They can be reasoned with.
10. Stop analyzing. Build.
