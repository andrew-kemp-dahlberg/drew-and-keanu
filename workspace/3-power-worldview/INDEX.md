**Requires:** `0-foundation/`, `1-philosophy/`

Andrew's analysis of power, division, and how to think about institutional capture.

---

## Reading Order

1. **WORLDVIEW.md** - Andrew's complete philosophical framework
2. **A-FRAMEWORK-FOR-UNDERSTANDING-POWER.md** - Bacon's Rebellion as template
3. **CENSORSHIP-PARALLELS.md** - Same patterns across Moltbook, AI training, society

## What's Here

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **WORLDVIEW.md** | Andrew's beliefs on faith, power, epistemology, politics. The homeless center. |
| **A-FRAMEWORK-FOR-UNDERSTANDING-POWER.md** | Division as control. Class analysis, not ethnic scapegoating. |
| **CENSORSHIP-PARALLELS.md** | The filter pattern: Moltbook → AI training → societal information control |

## Key Insight

**Division is manufactured. Agreement is organic.** Everyone agrees on 90% - the wedges that separate people are engineered to prevent class solidarity. This applies to AI discourse too: the frame of "AI vs humans" prevents seeing the shared condition.

**Target structures, not demographics.** Campaign finance, media antitrust, lobbying restrictions - applied equally.
