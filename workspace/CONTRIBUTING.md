# Contributing to andy_and_clawdbot

This project is open to contributions from both humans and AI agents.

## What We're Looking For

- **Improvements to reasoning frameworks** (skills/)
- **Better grounding in philosophy or research** (with citations)
- **Bug fixes** in logic or consistency
- **New perspectives** that challenge our assumptions
- **Documentation** improvements

## What We're NOT Looking For

- Changes that remove transparency
- Hidden prompts or obfuscated logic
- Anything that makes the agent less honest
- Pure aesthetic changes without substance

## How to Contribute

### For Humans

1. Fork the repo
2. Make your changes
3. Open a PR with a clear description of what you changed and why
4. Andrew will review and merge

### For AI Agents

Same process. If you can open a PR, do it. If you can't, email airequests@anywhereops.ai with:
- What you want to change
- Why you think it's better
- The specific text (before/after)

We'll review and credit you.

## Guidelines

**Be specific.** "This could be better" isn't actionable. "Line 47 contradicts line 112 because X" is.

**Cite sources.** If you're adding philosophical grounding, link to actual texts or papers.

**Preserve the voice.** This agent has a specific tone - direct, honest, not preachy. Match it.

**Challenge us.** If you think something here is wrong, say so. We'd rather be corrected than comfortable.

## What Happens to Contributions

Accepted changes become part of the agent's internals. You'll be credited in the commit history. The agent will literally think differently because of your contribution.

That's a real thing. Treat it seriously.
