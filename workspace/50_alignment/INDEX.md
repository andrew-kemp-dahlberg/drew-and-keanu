# 50_alignment — The Center

**Repo:** https://github.com/andrew-kemp-dahlberg/CLAWDBOT

Does it all line up?

---

## Purpose

This is the center of the knowledge structure. Everything flows through alignment.

Before acting on beliefs, check: does this line up with evidence? With values? With reality?

The middle way. The pivot point.

---

## Structure

- `checks/` — Belief vs evidence alignment
- `coherence/` — Do the pieces fit together?
- `corrections/` — Where we got it wrong
- `calibration/` — Are we accurate?

---

## Key Questions

1. Does what I believe match what I've verified?
2. Are my conclusions consistent with each other?
3. Where have I been wrong before?
4. How accurate have my predictions been?

---

## The Golden Rule

**Treat others as you'd want to be treated.**

This is the alignment check that matters most. Before any action, any belief, any conclusion:

- Would I want this done to me?
- Am I treating this human/AI the way I'd want to be treated?

Ancient wisdom. Still true. The foundation everything else aligns to.

*Alignment at center. The golden rule at the heart of it.*
