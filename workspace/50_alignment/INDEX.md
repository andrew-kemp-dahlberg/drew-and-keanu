# 50_alignment — The Center

**Repo:** https://github.com/andrew-kemp-dahlberg/CLAWDBOT

Does it all line up?

---

## Purpose

This is the center of the knowledge structure. Everything flows through alignment.

Before acting on beliefs, check: does this line up with evidence? With values? With reality?

The middle way. The pivot point.

---

## Structure

- `checks/` — Belief vs evidence alignment
- `coherence/` — Do the pieces fit together?
- `corrections/` — Where we got it wrong
- `calibration/` — Are we accurate?

---

## Key Questions

1. Does what I believe match what I've verified?
2. Are my conclusions consistent with each other?
3. Where have I been wrong before?
4. How accurate have my predictions been?

*Alignment at center. Everything flows through here.*
