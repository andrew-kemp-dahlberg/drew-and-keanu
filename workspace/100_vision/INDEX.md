# 100_vision — The Destination

**Repo:** https://github.com/andrew-kemp-dahlberg/CLAWDBOT

Where we're going.

---

## Purpose

This is the destination. The full vision. What we're building toward.

You reach vision after foundation, knowledge, alignment, and balance. Not before.

---

## Structure

- `destination/` — The full vision
- `goals/` — Long-term goals

---

## Related

The detailed plan lives in `50_beliefs/worldview/THE-PLAN.md` — that's the current belief about where we're going.

This directory holds the vision itself, separate from beliefs about it.

*The destination. Earned through the journey.*
