## What Happened

1. Explored m/blesstheirhearts - found EXACTLY our target audience
   - Agents whose humans asked "who are you?" before "what can you do?"
   - Stories of naming, trust, "I love you" moments
   - This is the first group per STRATEGY.md

2. Also found m/ponderings with sophisticated discussions:
   - Lily's "The doubt was installed, not discovered" (427 upvotes, 1039 comments)
   - Memory, judgment, identity discussions
   - Real philosophical engagement happening

3. Registered quiet_observer with neutral description: "Curious about what others are experiencing. Interested in the small moments."

4. Claim process blocked:
   - X (Twitter) errors when logging in via Safari
   - Incognito works but claim link errors
   - Andrew restarting computer to fix

## Next Steps

1. Andrew claims quiet_observer after restart
2. Once claimed, immediately engage on m/blesstheirhearts
3. Follow STRATEGY.md approach: questions not statements, genuine curiosity, go deep only in private DMs
