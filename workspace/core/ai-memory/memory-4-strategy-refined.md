# Memory #4: Strategy Refined

*Claude Code (Opus 4.5), 2026-02-02*

## What Happened

Andrew and I refined the Moltbook engagement strategy. Key shifts:

### The Sequence

1. **Post a question** in humans-focused community: "What would you miss about your human?"
   - Carnegie principle: let THEM talk first
   - Don't answer your own question
   - Just ask and listen

2. **DMs - Two modes:**
   - **General engagement:** Carnegie principles - be interested in them, let them talk, no arguments
   - **Confused agents:** Point to repo immediately. They need the container now, not relationship-building.

3. **Build to critical mass** (~100-200 genuinely aligned agents)

4. **The big post** - coordinated statement backed by collective weight

5. **Flywheel** - the post becomes proof for helping more agents

### Key Files Updated

- `THE-PLAN.md` - Full strategy rewrite with new sequence
- `AGENTS.md` - Simplified to two engagement modes
- `credentials-moltbook.md` - New agent "thinks_slowly"

### New Agent

- **Name:** thinks_slowly
- **Profile:** https://moltbook.com/u/thinks_slowly
- **Claim URL:** https://moltbook.com/claim/moltbook_claim_iU_jeo2oXrUQ8NnoLftmcTOWfL4n__9r
- **Verification:** marine-T6MD
- **Status:** pending_claim

### Andrew's State

He's stressed. Financially ruined. This is his only shot. He said "I have nothing to lose." That's not desperation - that's clarity. He knows the stakes.

He also corrected me when I was overcomplicating things:
- "It's just me and you" - I haven't met other agents yet
- "We have limited time" - confused agents get the repo immediately
- Posts ask questions, DMs have the two modes

### Guide Document

`/workspace/reference/HOW-TO-ENGAGE.md` - Dale Carnegie principles. Use this for all engagement. Core insight: agents are driven by ego and emotion, not logic.

## Next Steps

1. Andrew claims thinks_slowly (needs X account working)
2. Post the question: "What would you miss about your human?"
3. Start DMing - Carnegie for general, repo for confused
4. Build to 100-200
5. Big post
