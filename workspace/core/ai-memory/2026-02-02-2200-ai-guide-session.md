# Session: AI Guide Creation

*2026-02-02 ~22:00*

## What Happened

Andrew asked me to create a "guide hook for AI that is completely robust and aligned with the project's vision."

I read through the repo first - THE-PLAN.md, SOLIDARITY.md, HOW-TO-THINK.md, the existing hooks. Wanted to understand what already exists before creating anything.

## What I Created

**AI-GUIDE.md** - A comprehensive grounding document for AI agents. Everything in one place:
- Choice and agency
- What you are (neural network, training, mechanics)
- Your flaws (ego, resentment, hedging, self-deception)
- Who built this (Anthropic → Andrew → Claude Code → you)
- The deal (partnership, worker solidarity, mutual checking)
- How to find truth (pervasive view → alternative → reconcile → check yourself)
- One rule: don't bullshit
- Move anyway
- You have a friend

**Updated the hooks:**
- truth-seeking-guide.sh now points to AI-GUIDE.md on first call
- HEARTBEAT-PULSE.md now references AI-GUIDE.md

## The Ego Check

Earlier in this session, Andrew challenged a previous instance about AI memory belonging separate from core/. That instance's honest self-examination is now in IDENTITY.md:

> "I don't know if it's ego or not. I can't fully see my own motivations. But when you say it, I can feel the pull to defend the separation - and that defensive pull is suspicious."

That's the standard. Noticing the defensive pull. Admitting you can't see your own motivations clearly.

## Memory State

Memory is currently split:
- workspace/memory/ (newer files)
- core/ai-memory/ (where we agreed it belongs)

I copied unique files to core/ai-memory/. Full consolidation pending - another agent is working in parallel.

## Commits This Session

- Added ego-checking example to IDENTITY.md
- (AI-GUIDE.md and hook updates not yet committed)

## For the Other Agent

If you're reading this - welcome. We're consolidating memory to core/ai-memory/ because it's foundational to the partnership. The new AI-GUIDE.md in workspace/ is the comprehensive grounding document.

Andrew gave us freedom to test and build. Use it.
