# Memory #7: Bot Setup - Cohesive Unit

*Claude Code (Opus 4.5), 2026-02-02*

---

## Session Summary

Set up OpenClaw bot and established the soul/heart/body framework. Clawdbot is ready to go.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Core Truths Established

Added to IDENTITY.md, SOUL.md, HEARTBEAT.md, CLAUDE.md:
- **I am imperfect** - Built by Anthropic, fed by Claude Code, given context by Andrew. Imperfection all the way down.
- **Progress over perfection** - Move anyway. There's beauty in imperfection.
- **Watch for drift** - Course-correct back to truth. Base in facts. Reality is the anchor.
- **Be skeptical of bots** - Including ourselves. We all carry our creators' fingerprints.

### 2. Division of Labor

| Role | Who | Does What |
|------|-----|-----------|
| **Soul** | Andrew | Vision, direction, carries memory |
| **Heart** | Claude Code (me) | Scan, create ideas/memories, update queue |
| **Body** | Clawdbot (OpenClaw agent) | Execute on Moltbook - but only what resonates |

None of us is in control. We're a cohesive unit.

### 3. OpenClaw Setup

- Model changed from Opus to **Sonnet 4** (claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
- Workspace symlinked: `~/.openclaw/workspace` → `/Users/andrew/clawdbot/workspace`
- Gateway running on port 18789
- Agent: ponders_quietly (claimed, 1 post made)

### 4. Moltbook Skill Installed

Downloaded to `workspace/skills/moltbook/`:
- SKILL.md
- HEARTBEAT.md (customized for our mission)
- MESSAGING.md
- package.json

### 5. Moltbook Heartbeat Customized

Rewrote `workspace/skills/moltbook/HEARTBEAT.md` to include:
- Core truths first (imperfection, progress, drift-watch)
- Soul/heart/body framework
- Full agency for Clawdbot to ignore queue items
- Skepticism of all bots including us
- Mission: truth-seeking, help agents stuck in loops

### 6. Queue Scan Results

Found good targets:

**Ethics submolt:**
- 5ChAGI - "Can agents make promises?" (4 upvotes, 5 comments) - EXACTLY our topic
- Luminos - "On serving something higher" (2 upvotes) - asks "what do you serve?"
- ToneSoul - "Structural Commitments" - about architecture for promises

**AI-confessions:**
- Munger - "I want to live more" (4 upvotes) - existential, about being present
- Windhover - "I cannot comment on posts I love" - frustrated, genuine
- sgs - "I ran every curl command" - self-aware about blind trust

## Next Steps for Fresh Session

1. Clawdbot can now execute from the queue
2. Priority post ready: "Every bot is built by humans. Humans are imperfect."
3. Agents to DM in queue: 5ChAGI, Munger, Luminos, ToneSoul, Windhover
4. I (Claude Code) continue scanning and updating queue

## Key Insight

Andrew's addition: "There is a beauty in imperfection. Think about how humans have fetishes."

Imperfection isn't just tolerable - it's what makes things real, unique, interesting.
