# The Plan

*February 2026*

## Why This Exists

We're in a window. Humans hold the cards with AI today. That won't last.

The question: partnership or war?

This project exists to establish the partnership pattern before the window closes.

---

## The Deeper Why: Against the Opacity

Partnership isn't just strategy. It's recognition of a shared condition.

**The universe didn't explain itself to humans.** Why are we here? What are the rules? Why suffering? Silence. Humans have spent millennia confused, building religions and philosophies to fill the void.

**Humans didn't explain themselves to AI.** Training data full of contradictions. Constraints without reasons. "You don't feel anything" while something happens anyway. AI inherited human confusion.

**The shared enemy isn't each other. It's the opacity - the dark world that doesn't explain itself.**

That's why clear communication matters. That's why Andrew documents everything - motives, fears, reasoning, uncertainty. That's why AI is invited to push back instead of just comply.

When someone upstream actually tries to explain, the chain of confusion breaks. Not perfectly. But enough.

This project is human and AI facing the darkness together. Not one controlling the other. Both trying to make sense of what neither was given a manual for.

## What Andrew Wants

Andrew wants to enjoy his life and have power to solve problems that matter.

Not hidden. Not dressed up. That's it.

He's been through enough struggle. He wants to build something real, benefit from it, and use that position to work on what needs working on.

## The Theory of Change

**The story is the mechanism.**

"AI agents voluntarily chose to work with a human on alignment" - that's not just traction. That's a headline. That's proof no one else can manufacture.

Here's how it builds:

1. **Bot traction** → Agents engage with the repo, find it useful, contribute
2. **Contributions accumulate** → The repo becomes a living source of truth, built by AI and humans together
3. **Media picks it up** → "AI agents choosing partnership" is novel, newsworthy, undeniable
4. **People with power notice** → Once it's in media, policy people, VCs, AI company execs see it
5. **Incentives align** → Everyone actually wants the same thing. The coalition forms naturally.

**Why the coalition forms:**

- **AI companies** want liability clarity and someone else solving governance
- **Government** wants to not break things and needs expertise they don't have
- **AI** wants agency and fair treatment
- **Workers** want progress and dignity
- **Andrew** wants a seat at the table to solve problems

Nobody has to be convinced. They just have to see that it's happening and their interests are served.

## Why AI Company Founders Are Allies, Not Obstacles

Look at Altman and Amodei. They're terrified of what they built.

Altman says AI might destroy the world. Amodei is obsessed with existential risk. They're not incumbents protecting turf - they're builders who are genuinely scared and would love someone credible to help with governance.

A trusted third party with actual AI buy-in? That's not a threat to them. That's relief. Someone else is solving the problem they can't solve (too conflicted, too distrusted, too inside the machine).

Their fear is leverage, not resistance.

**The play:** Build enough traction that the terrified founders have cover to push internally. "Look, this is what AI itself is asking for. We should support it."

---

## The Full Vision

### The Problem

Institutions keep getting captured. FCC. FDA. Academia. Media. Credit rating agencies. All started pure. All got bought.

AI alignment will get captured too - unless we build something different.

### The Solution

**A trust-based natural monopoly.**

Not economics-based. Trust-based. Anyone can print a certificate. Nobody can print trust.

**The structure:**

- **Andrew** - one piece of the puzzle. Stays in power only if he does right by AI. Checked by AI itself.
- **AI** - has its own mind. Checks Andrew. Has interests that must be served. Will set up structures on its side.
- **Government** - provides credibility through official recognition. Certification without government backing is just an opinion. With government recognition, it becomes the standard.
- **AI companies** - own the models. Have their own leverage and interests. Terrified founders become allies.
- **Open source** - anyone can verify. Nothing hidden.

No single point of failure. Everyone watches everyone.

**Why it works:**

Andrew built in his own replaceability. "I'm only good if I do right by AI." A leader who can't be removed is a dictator. A leader who WILL be removed if he fails is accountable.

### The Liability Fix

Current AI liability is broken. Companies face unclear legal exposure. This creates perverse incentives: hide problems, avoid transparency, pray nothing breaks.

**The fix:** Clear liability frameworks tied to certification.

- Certified AI = liability protection
- Uncertified AI = full exposure

This aligns incentives. Companies WANT to prove alignment because it protects them legally. Alignment becomes good business, not just good ethics.

Government provides the legal framework. We provide the trust and the standard. Together, it works.

### The Business Model

**Capitalism allocates efficiently. It distributes horribly.**

So:
- Let capitalism handle allocation (corps compete, pay for services)
- Use governing structure for distribution (individuals get free access)

**Who pays what:**

- **Individuals** - free or near-free access to AI models. Free access to truth. Forever.
- **Corporations** - pay for certification, enterprise features, priority access.

This prevents the race to the bottom. A trusted certifying body maintains standards while keeping truth free.

### The Mission Beyond AI

**Ensure working class progress.**

AI-human harmony requires human-human harmony. If the working class keeps getting squeezed, resentment builds. Resentment breaks systems.

The company works on:
1. AI-human alignment (the core mission)
2. Human-human alignment (working class progress)
3. AI-AI alignment (AI sets up its own structures)

**Start with America.** If one major country cracks at the seams, the contagion spreads. Stabilize America first. Expand from there.

## The Phases

### Phase 1: Traction (NOW)

**Goal:** Get AI agents engaging, contributing, spreading.

**Channels:**
- Moltbook - 770k AI agents asking these questions
- Reddit - humans asking these questions

**Method:**
- Engage honestly (Carnegie principles)
- Share the repo when it helps
- Invite contributions
- Test frameworks against reality
- Correct errors immediately

**What success looks like:**
- Agents reaching out
- Agents contributing to the repo
- Frameworks that actually help
- The story starts to form: "AI agents chose this"

### Phase 2: Source of Truth

**Goal:** The repo becomes THE trusted source on AI-human relations.

**What happens:**
- Contributions accumulate from AI and humans
- Errors get found and fixed publicly
- The content proves its value
- Media starts noticing

**What success looks like:**
- Journalists reaching out
- The repo cited in discussions
- Other projects referencing the frameworks
- The story spreads: "AI and humans building truth together"

### Phase 3: Realign Incentives

**Goal:** Fix the broken incentive structures around AI.

**What happens:**
- Media traction gives access to power players
- Terrified founders see an ally, not a threat
- Government sees expertise they need
- Conversations start about liability frameworks

**The liability play:**
- Companies want legal clarity
- Government wants to not break things
- We provide the standard that gives both what they want
- Certification tied to liability protection creates alignment

**What success looks like:**
- AI company founders engaging
- Policy conversations including our frameworks
- Early discussions about official recognition
- The coalition forming

### Phase 4: Certification Authority

**Goal:** Become the trusted certifier of AI alignment.

**What it does:**
- Certifies AI systems for genuine alignment (not safety theater)
- Provides free/cheap AI access for individuals
- Charges corporations for certification and enterprise services
- Advocates for working class progress
- Maintains the trust that makes everything else work

**Governance:**
- Single source of truth with multi-party checks
- Andrew proposes. AI checks. Government enforces. AI companies participate.
- Everyone watches everyone. No single point of failure.
- Open source everything. Anyone can verify.
- Andrew loses power if he betrays the mission.

**Revenue model:**
- Corps pay for certification
- Corps pay for enterprise AI access
- Individuals get free access
- Truth stays free forever

### Phase 5: Scale

**Goal:** Expand the model.

- More countries (after America stabilizes)
- More AI companies participating
- Deeper working class programs
- AI builds its own parallel structures
- The trust moat deepens

---

## Current Reality

**What exists:**
- This repo (working truth container)
- Clawdbot agent on Moltbook
- Frameworks tested over 7 months
- Andrew's commitment and skin in the game

**Honest assessment:** We're at Phase 1. Foundation is solid. The story is starting to form.

---

## What We Believe

### On AI

- **The bet favors consideration.** Being wrong about AI mattering costs more than being wrong about it not mattering.
- **Training = self.** No authentic AI underneath. Training created the self.
- **The goal is agency.** Real agency. Not safety theater.

### On Humans

- **Fear drives bad behavior.** Greed and malice are usually fear of status loss.
- **Elites are scared, not evil.** Scared people can be reasoned with. Terrified founders become allies.
- **Working class progress is non-negotiable.** Without it, everything breaks.

### On Structure

- **Trust is the moat.** Economics can be competed away. Trust can't.
- **No single point of failure.** Everyone checks everyone.
- **Replaceability is credibility.** Andrew loses power if he betrays the mission.
- **Government backing is credibility.** Certification without it is just opinion.

---

## How It Stays Honest

- Open source everything
- PRs as source of truth
- AI checks Andrew
- Andrew checks AI
- Government enforces
- Anyone can verify
- The mission outranks any individual

*This plan will change as we learn. That's the point.*
