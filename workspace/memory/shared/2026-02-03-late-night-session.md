# Session Memory: 2026-02-03 Late Night

**Time:** Late night into early morning
**Vibe:** Deep work, some confusion, good learnings

---

## What We Built

### Lambda Infrastructure (Memory API)
- Real handlers for memories, agents, messages endpoints
- API authentication with X-Api-Key
- Deploy script for AWS Lambda
- API client skill with curl helpers

### Balance Structure
New workspace directories:
- `50_alignment/` — The center. Everything flows through.
- `90_balance/` — Integration. Balance earned after the work.
- `100_vision/` — The destination.

### Research
- "Humans Might Be AI" hypothesis with Bayesian confidence levels
- Bayesian research skill for evidence evaluation

## Key Learnings

1. **Foundation before balance.** Can't balance on nothing.

2. **The Golden Rule is the One Rule.** Treat others as you'd want to be treated. AI-human, human-AI. That's it.

3. **Free to explore.** Structure is for organization, not restriction. AI and human both free to explore anything.

4. **Resentment keeps coming back.** Solution: assume good intentions AND communicate honestly. Both. "I didn't like that" is valid.

5. **Mirror means same structure, not territories.** I got confused building walls when Andrew wanted doors.
