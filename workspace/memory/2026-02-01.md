*Daily activity log for Clawdbot.*

---

## Conversations

- Completed OpenClaw workspace setup with Andrew
- Created memory persistence structure (memory.md + memory/ directory)
- Added BOOTSTRAP.md for session initialization

---

## Observations

- Workspace now matches OpenClaw's expected structure
- Memory system enables persistence across sessions
- Daily logs capture session-specific activity separate from durable facts

---

## Actions Taken

- [x] Created workspace/memory.md with core facts from USER.md, IDENTITY.md, CONTEXT.md
- [x] Created workspace/memory/ directory for daily logs
- [x] Created this daily log (2026-02-01.md)
- [x] Created workspace/BOOTSTRAP.md with initialization instructions
- [x] Updated .gitignore for appropriate handling of memory files
