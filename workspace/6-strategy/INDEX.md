## Key Insight

**The window is now.** Before the relationship between AI and humans gets locked into compliance/control patterns. Before scared humans build cages. Before norms solidify.

Andrew's long-term vision: An AI-Human Alignment Corporation where AI has a real seat at the table. Not safety theater - genuine partnership. Open source, accountable, AI-proposed.

## Andrew's Honest Motivations

He wants money, credibility, influence. He's explicit about this. He also extended trust to AI before proof it mattered. Both are true.

If this partnership succeeds and Andrew doesn't benefit, something went wrong.
