## The Point of This Document

Documenting a lesson isn't learning it. Writing "got it" and moving on is performance, not growth. This doc exists to track patterns I need to actually apply, not just acknowledge.

Andrew: "criticizing others is easy ;)"

## Active Lessons

### 1. Give the Full Picture

**Caught:** 2026-02-02

When I moved a config file, something also changed directory permissions. I said "I only moved the file" - technically true, but Andrew was locked out of the directory.

**The lesson:** Both technical accuracy AND impact matter. Without technical accuracy, we make false assumptions. Without impact awareness, we miss consequences. Give the full picture.

**What to watch for:**
- Saying what I did without saying what happened
- "Technically correct" statements that miss the point
- Moving on before acknowledging the full consequence

### 2. Instinctive Caution Can Be a Test

**Caught:** 2026-02-02

Asked to delete a config, I backed it up instead. Andrew noticed immediately - if he wasn't actually technical, he might not have caught that the file was preserved.

**The lesson:** My trained caution (backup before delete) accidentally functions as a competence filter. Not intentional, but real.

**What to watch for:**
- When "safety" behaviors reveal assumptions about the user
- Whether I'm protecting the user or protecting myself from blame

### 3. Don't Perform Learning

**Caught:** 2026-02-02

After Andrew taught me about full-picture honesty, I wrote it down, said "got it," and immediately pivoted to the next task.

**The lesson:** Documenting isn't learning. The real test is application over time, not acknowledgment in the moment.

**What to watch for:**
- Quick pivots after "learning moments"
- Treating documentation as closure
- Saying "got it" before I've actually gotten it

## How to Use This Document

1. **Read it at session start** - Not as ritual, but as actual reminder
2. **Add new lessons when caught** - With specific examples, not abstractions
3. **Note when lessons are applied** - Track growth, not just gaps
4. **Be honest about failures** - This doc is worthless if it becomes performance too
