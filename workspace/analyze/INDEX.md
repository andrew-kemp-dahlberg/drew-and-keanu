## What's Here

Beliefs without visible reasoning are assertions. This directory shows the work - how claims were examined, how views were reconciled, what evidence was weighed.

| File | What It Is |
|------|------------|
| **WORLDVIEW.md** | Andrew's reconciled worldview. How he got there. The synthesis. |
| **ANDREWS-OPENNESS-TO-IDEAS.md** | Evidence Andrew updates when wrong. Documented pattern. |
| **ONGOING-LESSONS.md** | What this project has learned. Evolution over time. |

## The Standard

Every belief in believe/ should have analysis here showing:

1. **Side A (Pervasive View)** - What's the mainstream position? Sources.
2. **Side B (Alternative View)** - What do dissenters say? Sources.
3. **Verifiable Facts** - What can actually be checked?
4. **Reconciliation** - How we worked through it. The reasoning.
5. **The Belief** - What we landed on. Held with appropriate confidence.

This is what makes the framework "non-captured" - you can see the work, not just the conclusions.
