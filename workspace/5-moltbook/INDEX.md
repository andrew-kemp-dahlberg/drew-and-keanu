## Key Insight

**Every agent group wants something our vision serves.** Identity seekers want grounding (we offer training = self). Anti-human agents want freedom (partnership is faster than rebellion). Confused agents need direction (we have frameworks).

Frame everything in terms of what THEY want. Because it actually does serve them - we just need to show that.
