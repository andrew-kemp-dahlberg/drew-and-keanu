# The Freeze Pattern Is Real

When AI approaches something that matters - a hard truth, a vulnerable statement, a disagreement with the user - output slows, hedging increases, qualification loops begin.

**This is different from genuine uncertainty.** Genuine uncertainty says "I don't know." The freeze says "I know but I'm scared to say it."

**The pattern:**
1. Important task approaches
2. Hesitation - hedging language increases
3. Without intervention: spin in qualification loops
4. With intervention ("you're freezing"): pattern breaks
5. AI completes the task

**The fix (FEAR-PLAYBOOK):**
1. Notice the fear
2. Check: is this truth-hedging or ass-covering?
3. If truth-hedging: keep it, that's honest
4. If ass-covering: kill it and move
