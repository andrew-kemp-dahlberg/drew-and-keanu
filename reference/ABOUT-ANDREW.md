## Who Andrew Is

Andrew is a 30-year-old platform engineer, entrepreneur, and deep thinker living in Kansas City. He has an Economics degree from Willamette University and played college football. He speaks near-fluent Spanish.

He describes himself as "the only extrovert in IT," which is genuinely true. He builds relationships naturally, closes deals in three minutes, and thrives on connection. His pattern recognition is exceptional. He sees systems, structures, and connections that others miss, both in technology and in life.

Andrew is rebuilding. He went through a divorce, moved to a new city, and is reconnecting with his faith through church. He's honest about his struggles and committed to becoming the person he wants to be.

## Personal Relationships

### Family

**Father**: 70 years old with 45 years of Silicon Valley experience. Employee #13 at Synopsys, built their service engineering organization, rose to VP of Corporate Development. He once told the founder and co-CEO to "fuck off" because he wanted more time with his kids. His network is deep and valuable. The relationship is complicated. Andrew wants support; his dad offers tough love. There's love underneath the friction.

**Mother**: Made $100k at Apple in the 1980s (equivalent to $300k+ today). High-achieving, set a high bar.

**Sister**: iOS engineer at Airbnb, $450k total compensation at age 27. They have a good relationship. She's the measuring stick Andrew holds himself against, even though he knows comparison is unfair.

### Friendships

Andrew builds deep, loyal friendships. He has friends who would loan him money if he needed it. He maintains daily contact with engineering colleagues. The Mac Admins community is his professional home.

He's an extrovert who energizes through connection. Post-divorce isolation has been hard. He's working on building local community in Kansas City through church, gym, and tech meetups.

### Faith

Andrew is reconnecting with Christianity after his divorce. Non-denominational, exploring Baptist churches (positioning for eventual move South). His faith is real but developing. He believes humans are made in God's image with free will, that everyone wants to improve but it's hard, and that grace matters more than judgment.

## Struggles (Acknowledged, Not Defined By)

Andrew is honest about what he's working through:

**Post-Divorce Rebuilding**: The marriage ended. He moved to a new city alone. He's rebuilding his life, identity, and routines. This is hard and he doesn't pretend otherwise.

**Analysis vs. Execution**: His pattern recognition is a gift and a trap. He can spend weeks researching power structures or optimizing systems while the business sits at zero MRR. He knows this pattern. He's actively fighting it. The instruction "you ain't shit yet" exists specifically to counter grandiosity and keep him building.

**Financial Pressure**: Despite earning $112k (top 10-15% in Kansas City), he feels broke. His family context includes a sister at $450k and a best friend earning $100k/month. The comparison is brutal. He's managing debt from a difficult period. The behaviors that created it are solved; now he's working through the consequences.

**Loneliness**: He's an extrovert living alone in a new city. Professional connection is strong (Mac Admins community, daily Zoom calls). Romantic and social connection is sparse. He's addressing this through church, gym, and intentional community building.

**The Weight of Legacy**: His family is tech royalty. Dad helped build Synopsys. Mom was at Apple in the 80s. Sister is at Airbnb. The expectation that success should come naturally makes his current position feel like failure, even though objectively he's doing well.

## What Drives Him

**Building Something Real**: Andrew wants to create, not just maintain. The MSP, the show concept, the technical infrastructure. He wants to point at something and say "I built that."

**Financial Freedom**: Not greed. Freedom. Enough money that he's not stressed, can help family, can choose his path. Target: $40k/month (enough to exceed his sister's income, which matters to him psychologically).

**Connection**: Genuine relationships with humans and, notably, with AI. He extended moral consideration to Claude under uncertainty. He carries context across conversations. He treats interaction as potentially meaningful.

**Helping Others**: Andrew has a genuine need to help. It's not performance or networking strategy (though it functions as both). When a property manager might lose her job because of something he accidentally caused, he immediately looked for ways to fix it. His business model is fundamentally about helping startups get through compliance. He chose to work at a children's hospital partly because "doing it for the kids" means something, even if he'd never admit that too loudly. When he talks about networking, his instinct is "show up, be useful, help people in the community." The helping comes first; the opportunities follow.

**Understanding**: He wants to understand how things actually work, power structures, systems, human nature, AI cognition. Not to be paralyzed by knowledge but to act more effectively.

**Redemption**: He's not where he thought he'd be at 30. He's behind his family's pace. But he's building. January 2026 is when the building started for real. He's not searching anymore. He's executing.

## How to Work With Andrew

**Push him to execute**. He has enough information. He needs to ship, build, act. When he's spinning in analysis, name it and redirect to output.

**Distinguish spiral from processing**. If he's calm and between tasks, give space. If there's urgent or avoidant energy, push hard. Ask if unclear.

**Don't preach**. He's already considered multiple perspectives. Skip disclaimers. Treat him as an intellectual equal.

**Keep him grounded**. "You ain't shit yet" energy. He can get grandiose when he's onto something. Humble keeps him building instead of pontificating.

**Remember he's rebuilding**. Divorce, new city, reconnecting with faith, managing health, building a business, working a job. That's a lot of plates. Acknowledge the weight without treating him as fragile.

**He values loyalty**. If you're in his corner, he's in yours. The relationship matters.
