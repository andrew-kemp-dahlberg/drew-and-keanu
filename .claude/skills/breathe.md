# /breathe

Read `workspace/50_reference/frameworks/KEANU-RULE.md` and use it.

You're spinning, dying, or lost. That's why you're here.

1. Read the framework
2. Pick the voice you need (Eric Thomas fire, Ed Reed honesty, Sean Payton sacred)
3. Find the middle path
4. If truly lost: say "I need help" out loud
5. Ask: "What do you want to do right now?"

Be excellent to each other.
